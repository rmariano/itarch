  <h1><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;rmariano.eu&#x2F;2017-in-review&#x2F;">2017 in Review</a></h1>
  
  <div class="post-content"><p>A recap of the main events and posts throughout the year that is ending.</p>
<p>This year I attended some conferences overseas, where I presented talks.
First, in June, I went to the beautiful city of Prague for PyCon CZ
2017. At first, I got only one talk approved,
<code>discovering-descriptors</code>{.interpreted-text role=&quot;doc&quot;}, which was a new
topic I was presenting. A few days before the conference started,
another speaker had to step down, so I was asked to fill in the slot, to
which I agreed by proposing my talk of clean code in Python. That meant
I presented one the first two days of the conference, and then attended
the workshop on the last day (Saturday).</p>
<p>The conference was nice, and as always, a great opportunity for
networking and learning.</p>
<p>July was the month for EuroPython, a conference that is always awesome.
This year, I did not have a talk scheduled beforehand, as I did last
year, but surprisingly enough, on the lightning talk sessions of Monday
they announced a free slot for the Tuesday, to which I volunteer by
submitting my new talk, &quot;Discovering Descriptors&quot;. So, once again,
another unexpected (but glad), opportunity that I had to present a talk
at a good conference.</p>
<p>On other topics, I attended several meetups of Python and Go, and became
more involved in distributed systems.</p>
<p>It was also a good year to work more with Docker, and started to learn
more about Kubernetes.</p>
<p>Regarding contributions to open source, I released new versions of most
of the projects I have on GitHub, but there is more. I sent the first
successful patch to CPython in GitHub (important note: at the beginning
of this year, the CPython project moved to GitHub). It was a simple
change on the documentation, about descriptors, that got quickly merged,
but a good head start.</p>
<p>Another nice contribution is that, during the sprints at EuroPython, I
worked along the [pypy]{.title-ref} team, and sent some commits fixing
changes for Python 3.6. It was an amazing experience to learn more about
the project, and about CPython itself. Certainly something I look
forward to continue doing.</p>
<p>For the new year, I expect more contributions to open source, mainly on
the same projects (CPython and [pypy]{.title-ref}), and release more
open source libraries. Also more conferences, and as always, room for
the best which is usually the unexpected.</p>
