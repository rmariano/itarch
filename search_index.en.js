distribuido\nglobalmente? Caso Open Stack3: Hosted in the Red Hat's offices\nin Buenos Aires, this talk was a very interesting one, on which I\nlearned about the collaborative way of working of the Open Stack\nteam, around the globe.\n(17 Nov 2016) Python Barcelona\nmeetup.\n(9 Dec 2016) Barcelona Spark meetup4\n(22 Dec 2016) Python Barcelona December meetup5: I presented my\ntalk about clean code in Python (yes, again :-), and there were two\nother interesting talks. Mine was the first one of the evening. The\nsecond talk, was about zc.buildout, an interesting tool for\nmanaging packages and environments in Python, which I first heard of\nat PyconAr (Python Argentina group) 2012. The third and last talk,\npresented a project named aiocache6: a cache system implemented\nin asyncio, that supports multiple back-ends. The talk walked us\nthrough the code, its architecture, and some use cases with demos.\n\nCode wise\nI started with a small contribution to the coala project7, and\nduring the EuroPython sprints I contributed to aiohttp with a pull\nrequest.\nThere were two new releases of my vim\nconfiguration,\nversions v0.3 and v0.48, which is great because is the single\ntool I use every day, and it is nice to have several improvements on it.\nI also enhanced my dot files,\nbut that is still in beta.\nOn general\nA minor release of Python3.5, but most importantly: Python3.6 was\nrecently released!\nThere were two releases of Fedora, 24 and 25, and there were lots of\nimprovements and changes in the Linux Kernel.\nRegarding information security, there were some issues in the Linux\nKernel, also in applications (such as dirty COW, etc.), and a massive\nDDoS attack that stroke the Internet on October, due to IoT devices\nbeing compromised.\nWhat to look forward to for the new year\n\nI still look forward for more contributions to open source, in\nparticular with CPython.\nMore functional programming (Scala/Haskell maybe), low-level\nprogramming in C, and research in the field of infosec.\nKeep on participating on technical conferences.\n\nAnd a lot more.\n1\nhttps://www.protosec.org/en/\n\n2\nhttps://www.meetup.com/es-ES/Cordoba-Python-Meetup/events/233741709/\n\n3\nhttps://www.meetup.com/es/ArquitecturaDeSoftware/events/233824352/\n\n4\nhttps://www.meetup.com/Spark-Barcelona/events/235763327/\n\n5\nhttps://www.meetup.com/python-185/events/236196808/\n\n6\nhttps://github.com/argaen/aiocache\n\n7\nhttps://github.com/coala/coala\n\n8\nhttps://github.com/rmariano/vim-config/releases\n\n","id":"https://rmariano.eu/2016-in-review/","title":"2016 in review"},"https://rmariano.eu/2017-in-review/":{"body":"A recap of the main events and posts throughout the year that is ending.\nThis year I attended some conferences overseas, where I presented talks.\nFirst, in June, I went to the beautiful city of Prague for PyCon CZ\n2017. At first, I got only one talk approved,\ndiscovering-descriptors{.interpreted-text role=\"doc\"}, which was a new\ntopic I was presenting. A few days before the conference started,\nanother speaker had to step down, so I was asked to fill in the slot, to\nwhich I agreed by proposing my talk of clean code in Python. That meant\nI presented one the first two days of the conference, and then attended\nthe workshop on the last day (Saturday).\nThe conference was nice, and as always, a great opportunity for\nnetworking and learning.\nJuly was the month for EuroPython, a conference that is always awesome.\nThis year, I did not have a talk scheduled beforehand, as I did last\nyear, but surprisingly enough, on the lightning talk sessions of Monday\nthey announced a free slot for the Tuesday, to which I volunteer by\nsubmitting my new talk, \"Discovering Descriptors\". So, once again,\nanother unexpected (but glad), opportunity that I had to present a talk\nat a good conference.\nOn other topics, I attended several meetups of Python and Go, and became\nmore involved in distributed systems.\nIt was also a good year to work more with Docker, and started to learn\nmore about Kubernetes.\nRegarding contributions to open source, I released new versions of most\nof the projects I have on GitHub, but there is more. I sent the first\nsuccessful patch to CPython in GitHub (important note: at the beginning\nof this year, the CPython project moved to GitHub). It was a simple\nchange on the documentation, about descriptors, that got quickly merged,\nbut a good head start.\nAnother nice contribution is that, during the sprints at EuroPython, I\nworked along the [pypy]{.title-ref} team, and sent some commits fixing\nchanges for Python 3.6. It was an amazing experience to learn more about\nthe project, and about CPython itself. Certainly something I look\nforward to continue doing.\nFor the new year, I expect more contributions to open source, mainly on\nthe same projects (CPython and [pypy]{.title-ref}), and release more\nopen source libraries. Also more conferences, and as always, room for\nthe best which is usually the unexpected.\n","id":"https://rmariano.eu/2017-in-review/","title":"2017 in Review"},"https://rmariano.eu/2018-in-review/":{"body":"It was a great year, let's take a look at the main highlights.\nEarly in January, I presented a\ntalk at a local\nmeetup, which had a good reception amongst the audience. The fist part\nof the year was a great period for learning more about distributed\nsystems, event sourcing, and event-driven architectures. The peak of\nwhich was attending the Kafka summit in\nLondon.\nBy late August/early September I finished my book Clean code in\nPython\nwhich was a quite challenging experience.\nIt was a great pleasure to attend the Python San\nSebastián conference. I've heard about\nthis conference in a lightning talk in EuroPython, and I was curious\nabout it. It was good to meet a group of friendly new people, and having\nthe opportunity to present there (an enhanced version of the talk\npresented at the meetup in January). Besides, the city is amazing, so\nit's certainly something to repeat!\nBesides some improvements in my configuration files (vim and dot files),\nand to some of my other public repositories, there wasn't that much\nroom for open source contributions. On the other hand, there was a good\ndeal of learning: I've read some fantastic books about software\nengineering (such as Facts and fallacies of software engineering,\nObject-oriented software construction, and more), which unfortunately\nI wasn't able to cover in blog posts (but maybe in the future I will),\nand I successfully completed the machine learning course offered by\nCoursera, which was\namazing. Again, maybe in a future post I will be able to properly\nreview it, but for now I can just tell you that is highly recommendable,\nif you're looking forward to learn a ton and at the same time have fun\nsolving programming assignments.\nAll in all, it was a year with a lot of positive notes. Looking forward\nto an amazing 2019 for everyone!\n","id":"https://rmariano.eu/2018-in-review/","title":"2018 in review"},"https://rmariano.eu/2019-in-review/":{"body":"Another year went by, and although I haven't blogged that much this\nyear, quite a few things did happen. Let's take a quick review of them.\nAs you know, I attended FOSDEM 2019,\nback in February, and it was an exhilarating event.\nI also took the opportunity to dive more into functional programming\nwith Scala, by completing the online course in Coursera (which I highly\nrecommend).\nOn the open source front, I started with some humble contributions to\nthe grpc project, with the goal to add\nasynchronous support for the Python implementation.\nI also read many interesting books. Among those about software\nengineering, I would also like to recommend Software Creativity 2.0 by\nRobert\nGlass.\nWhat to look forward to for the 2020? I would like to repeat the\nFOSDEM experience, and keep on contributing to open source projects,\nas much as possible. There's also the possibility (however I can't\npromise anything), that I might start a YouTube channel, with content\nsimilar to the one on this blog. But as always there will be more that I\ncan't anticipate; the best is usually the unexpected!\nHappy 2020 to everybody!\n","id":"https://rmariano.eu/2019-in-review/","title":"2019 in Review"},"https://rmariano.eu/a-few-ideas-on-code-review/":{"body":"After watching a talk about code review1, from the last EuroPython, I\ngot some ideas that I'd like to summarise.\nThe first one is a point I made on my talk about clean code in\nPython, about running style checks\n(PEP-8, for example), automatically as part of the CI. This has several\nrationales, the first one being that it's the sort of thing machines\nshould do, and not humans. Having software engineers reviewing the tabs,\nspacing, and such, is just a wasted effort (not to mention, wasted\nmoney). As I mentioned on the conclusions during my talk, we should\nfocus on the readability of the code in terms of the logic, by asking\nourselves things like \"does this code make sense?\", rather than\n\"is the space before the comma correct?\". Remember, code is for\nhumans, not machines, it's a means of communication with the\ndevelopment team.\nBy automating these checks in the CI build2, we leave these details\nout of the scope, to focus on more important things, because in the end,\nthe ultimate goal of the code review is actually to find defects on the\ncode, and point them out for early correction.\nIn addition, separating the style checks, gives them a sense of\n\"objective metric\", because the author has to argue with an script,\ninstead of another developer. This also enforces the style guide for the\nproject, closer to the code.\nThen followed lots of more tips aimed at making code review more\neffective. For example, that it's important to also highlight positive\nthings found whilst looking at the code, and (arguably the most\nimportant one) that authors have to be receptive about feedback when\nplacing a pull request. This is perhaps the most difficult point,\nbecause most of the times we hear things like \"would you merge this\ncode?\", rather than \"would you give me feedback about this?\". Once\nagain, the goal of code review is not to challenge, but to find defects\non the code, so when placing a pull request, it's good for the author\nto keep in mind that reviewers are actually helping him or her, to\nimprove the quality of the work.

The reason\nwhy they're so powerful is because they enable us to control the core\noperations (get, set, delete)1, of an attribute in a given object, so\nthat we can hook a particular code, controlled by us, in order to\nmodify, change, or extend the original operation.\nA descriptor is an object that implements either __get__, __set__,\nor __delete__.\nAs of Python 3.6+2 the descriptor protocol entails these methods:\n\nWe'll understand better what the parameters mean, once we've seen some\nexamples of descriptors and how they're used.\nHow to use them\nIn order to use descriptors we need at least two classes: one for the\ndescriptor itself, and the class that is going to use the descriptor\nobjects (often referred to as the managed class).\nGetting Data\nConsider this basic example on which I have a fictional manager for\nvideo output, that can handle multiple devices. Each device is set with\na particular resolution, provided by a user. However, if for some reason\none of the devices does not have a rendering resolution set, we want to\nuse a default one, specified on the class definition.\nA possible implementation could look like this.\n\nIn this case resolution is a descriptor that implements only\n__get__(). If an instance of the display manager, has a resolution\nset, it will retrieve just that one. On the other hand, if it does not,\nthen when we access one of the class attributes like media.tv, what\nactually happens is that Python calls:\n\nWhich executes the code in the __get__() method of the descriptor,\nwhich in this case returns the default value, previously passed.\nIn general3 a code like:\n\nWill be translated to:\n\nWhen the descriptor is called from the class, and not the instance, the\nvalue of the parameter \"instance\" is None, but the \"owner\" is still\na reference to the class being invoked (that's probably one of the\nreasons why these are two separate parameters, instead of just let the\nuser derive the class from the instance, it allows even more\nflexibility).\nFor this reason, is common to handle this case, and return the\ndescriptor itself, which is the rationale behind the line:\n\nThat is why when you define a property in a class, and call it from an\ninstance object, you'll get the result of the computation of the\nmethod. However, if you call the property from the class, you get the\nproperty object.\nSetting Data\nExample: imagine we want to have some attributes in an object that are\ngoing to be traced, by other attributes that keep track, of how many\ntimes their values changed. So, for example, for every attribute &lt;x&gt;\non the object, there would be a corresponding count_&lt;x&gt; one, that\nwill keep count of how many times x changed its value. For simplicity\nlet's assume attributes starting with count_&lt;name&gt;, cannot be\nmodified, and those only correspond to the count of attribute &lt;name&gt;.\nThere may be several ways to address this problem. One way could be\noverriding __setattr__(). Another option, could be by the means of\nproperties (getters and setters) for each attribute we want to track.\nOr, we can use descriptors.\nBoth the properties, and __setattr__() approaches, might be subject to\ncode repetition. Their logic should be repeated for several different\nproperties, unless a property function builder is created (in order to\nreuse the logic of the property across several variables). As per the\n__setattr__() strategy, if we need to use this logic in multiple\nclasses we would have to come up with some sort of mixin class, in\norder to achieve it, and if one of the classes already overrides this\nmethod, things might get overcomplicated.\nThese two options seem rather convoluted. Descriptors it is, then.\n\nThe docstring on the Traveller class, pretty much explains its\nintended use. The important thing about this, is the public interface:\nit's absolutely transparent for the user. An object that interacts with\na Traveller instance, gets a clean interface, with the properties\nexposed, without having to worry about the underlying implementation.\nSo, we have two classes, with different responsibilities, but related,\nbecause they interact towards a common goal. Traveller has two class\nattributes that, are objects, instances of the descriptor.\nNow let's take a look at the other side of it, the internal working of\nthe descriptor.\nUnder this schema, Python will translate a call like:\n\nTo the one using the __set__ method in the descriptor, like:\n\nWhich means that the __set__ method on the descriptor is going to\nreceive the instance of the object being accessed, as a first parameter,\nand then the value that is being assigned.\nMore generally we could say that something like:\n\nTranslates to:\n\nWith these two parameters, we can manipulate the interaction any way we\nwant, which makes the protocol really powerful.\nIn this example, we are taking advantage of this, by querying the\noriginal object's attribute dictionary (instance.__dict__), and\ngetting the value in order to compare it with the newly received one. By\nreading this value, we calculate another attribute which will hold the\ncount of the number of times the attribute was modified, and then, both\nof them are updated in the original dictionary for the instance.\nAn important concept to point out is that this implementation not only\nworks, but it also solves the problem in a more generic fashion. In this\nexample, it was the case of a traveller, of whom we wanted to know how\nmany times changed of location, but the exact same object could be used\nfor example to monitor market stocks, variables in an equation, etc.\nThis exposes functionality as a sort of library, toolkit, or even\nframework. In fact, many well-known frameworks in Python use descriptors\nto expose their API.\nDeleting Data\nThe __delete__() method is going to be called when an instruction of\nthe type del &lt;instance&gt;.&lt;descriptor&gt; is executed. See the following\nexample.\n\nIn this example, we just want a property in the object, that cannot be\ndeleted, and descriptors, again, provide one of the multiple possible\nimplementations.\nCaveats and recommendations\n\nRemember that descriptors should always be used as class\nattributes.\nData should be stored in each original managed instance, instead of\ndoing data bookkeeping in the descriptor. Each object should have\nits data in its __dict__.\nPreserve the ability of accessing the descriptor from the class as\nwell, not only from instances. Mind the case when\ninstance is None, so it can be called as\ntype(instance).descriptor.\nDo not override __getattribute__(), or they might lose effect.\nMind the difference between data and non-data descriptors4.\nImplement the minimum required interface.\n\nFood for thought\nDescriptors provide a framework for abstracting away repetitive access\nlogic. The term framework here is not a coincidence. As the reader\nmight have noticed, by using descriptors, there is an inversion of\ncontrol (IoC) on the code, because Python will be calling the logic\nwe put under the descriptor methods, when accessing these attributes\nfrom the managed instance.\nUnder this considerations it is correct to think that it behaves as a\nframework.\nSummary\nDescriptors provide an API, to control the core access to an object's\ndata model, at its low-level operations. By means of descriptors we can\ncontrol the execution of an object's interface, because they provide a\ntransparent layer between the public interface (what is exposed to\nusers), and the internal representation and storage of data.\nThey are one of the most powerful features of Python, and their\npossibilities are virtually unlimited, so in this post we've only\nscratched the surface of them. More details, such as exploring the\ndifferent types of descriptors with their internal representation or\ndata, the use of the new __set_name__ magic method, their relation\nwith decorators, and analysis of good implementations, are some of the\ntopics for future entries.\n1\nPython Cookbook (3rd edition) - David Beazley &amp; Brian K.

As always, since this conference\ngrew so big (fact: if you tried to watch all videos in a row, it'll\ntake you about 9 weeks!), chances are, every review you read from the\nconference will contain something different, and therefore,\ncomplementary.\nThis is what I was able to experience. Let's take a look.\nA recurrent theme in FOSDEM seems to be the high concurrency. There\nwere lots of people attending, which made it difficult to make it into\nsome dev-rooms, as they were overcrowded. In addition, some very popular\ndev-rooms got regular-size rooms where not enough people could fit (for\nexample the PostgreSQL one, as opposed to last year). Because of this,\nI missed quite a few opportunities.\nHowever, another trait of the conference is not only the high\nconcurrency, but also the high quality of the talks. Therefore, falling\nback to some any other talk ended up on me learning about some cool\ntopic, with the added element of surprise.\nThe Talks\nOn Saturday, I started the morning in the free Java dev-room, and the\nfirst talk I watched was\nTornado VM: A Java VM for heterogeneous hardware. It introduced the\nidea of having a VM that takes advantage of different hardware (not just\nCPU, but also GPUs, and FPGAs as well). Though it was Java-focused, it\ndid mention that the concepts are applicable to other languages as well.\nThe followed a talk about\nByteBuffers. A\nreally nice presentation of the new memory management API (coming up to\nJava 14). It presented the rationale, common performance issues, the\ngoals of accessing memory on and off the heap, and such.\nAfterwards, I went to the The Hidden Early History of\nUnix.\nOne of the highlights of the conference was Fixing the Kubernetes\nclusterfuck. An\namazing talk (I highly recommend you watch the video), with a live\ndemonstration of how to hack (and detect) a Kubernetes cluster. It\nstarted with a very good introduction to the\nfalco project (how it's\nbuilt, how it works, how it integrates with another tools, and its\ncapabilities). It's a project with interesting features (like for\ninstance the fact that uses eBPF makes it have a minimal overhead).\nThe next three talks continued with the security theme. The first one of\nthem also about containers: Using SELinux with container\nruntimes,\nThe hairy issue of e2e encryption in instant\nmessaging,\nand What you most likely did not know about\nsudo.\nAnd that closed up the first day.\nOn Sunday, I started by attending two talks about monitoring and\nobservability. On [Distributed tracing for beginners]{.title-ref} we saw\na live demo of applying tracing to a Java application, from the ground\nup, and seeing the metrics with Jaeger.\nThen came a talk about Grafana: successfully correlate metics, logs,\nand traces\nwhich was a very good continuation. It was also interesting to learn\nabout upcoming features to Grafana (such as linking to traces from the\nmetrics graphs directly, and more integrations).\nAfterwards, I attended another talk about SWIM - Protocol to build a\ncluster, and on the same\nroom came the talk about Implementing protections against Speculative\nExecution side\nchannel:\na really technical and well-presented talk explaining low-level security\nimplications of side channel attacks, and some recommendations on how to\navoid some of those issues. The talk introduced the MDS / TAA threat\nmodels, and their implications. There were also really good questions\nasked at the end, that provided very interesting food for thought.\nOn the evening, I was able to finally make it into the PostgreSQL\ndev-room, and it was really worth it. The first talk was about The\nstate of full-text search on PostgreSQL\n12.\nIt properly explained some of the internals that go on, when we try to\nuse this feature, and some caveats to avoid. It had a really nice\nintroduction to information retrieval, and how it's implemented in\nPostgreSQL.\nFinally, RTFM\n(don't be misled --as I was--, by the title), presented four case\nstudies on which things went south, and why. The learnings on all cases,\nprovided valuable insights on how to make a better use of our relational\ndatabase.\nThen came the closing talk, celebrating the 20 years of the conference.\nAll in all, another good edition of the European conference for open\nsource. There's still lots of material that I would like to go over in\nmore detail, and some missed talks that I have to catch up on, but it\nwas a good experience.\n","id":"https://rmariano.eu/a-view-on-fosdem-2020/","title":"A View on FOSDEM 2020"},"https://rmariano.eu/about/":{"body":"The blog\nThe main topic of this blog is architecture in the context of software\nengineering.

For example, I've heard or read things like \"this is fine, it\nhas X% coverage\", or \"checking for coverage on pull requests doesn't\nhelp\", or \"dropping the coverage level is not an issue\", and many\nmore of the like.\nThis article aims to shed some light on the issue of unit testing with\nand code coverage. Hopefully by the end of it, we'll get an idea of\nwhich of the previous statements are right and which are wrong (spoiler\nalert: they're all wrong, but for different reasons).\nIt's not a metric\nI pretty much agree with Martin Fowler here1, about the fact that\ntest coverage is not a metric that indicates how good we are doing in\nterms of testing, but just a reference in order to identify parts of the\ncode that need to be tested.\nThis leads me to the idea that coverage is not a goal, or and ending\npoint, but just the starting point.\nWhat I mean by this is that imagine that you find in the coverage\nreport, that some lines are not being exercised, for example there are\ntwo functions that lack testing. Good head start, now we can write tests\nfor them. Now you go on and write a test for the first one. After that,\nyou run the tests again, and the coverage increased: the first function\nis now covered, so those lines no longer appear as missing in the\nreport. Now you might be thinking on moving on to writing tests for the\nsecond function. That's the trap. Testing should not stop there. What\nabout the rest of the tests scenarios for that first function? What\nabout testing with more input, different combinations of parameters,\nside effects, and more? That's why it's not a goal: we shouldn't stop\ntesting once we've satisfied the missing lines on the report.\nAnother reason why reaching 100% coverage it's not a valid goal, is\nbecause sometimes is unachievable. There are parts of the code that\nrespond to defensive programming2, and have some statements like\nassert(0) for unreachable conditions, which logically, if the code\nworks correctly, will never run (actually, the fact that it doesn't\nfail by reaching those lines when tests are run, works as a way of\nmaking the code to \"self-testable\", so to speak).\nNecessity and sufficiency\nAnd even if we reach that unrealistic goal: what does it mean to have\n100% code coverage on unit tests? Can we rely on that to say that the\ncode is fully tested, and there are no bugs? Absolutely not.\nHere I am not even talking about path coverage (sometimes referred to as\nmultiple condition coverage). To clarify, it's known that covering\nall branches does not mean the program will run just fine. Even with\nfunctional (manual or automated) testing. Suppose that we're completely\nsure all paths are covered, and the testing team has checked everything,\ntherefore we're sure all the logic is sound. It still doesn't mean the\nprogram is correct. There are runtime considerations to be taken into\naccount: what if there is a race condition? (something hard to\nreproduce). What if the server is under heavy load? (with a high load\naverage), what if malloc() at some point returns NULL? What if the\ndisk is full? Or if there is latency? What about security? You get the\npoint, the list of possible failure scenarios, is infinite.\nPutting those considerations aside, the crux question is: can unit tests\nprove the logic (again, not behaviour in runtime, just the logic), to be\ncorrect? No, because, even with all statements analysed, there is still\nthe possibility that things are left out.\nTo put it in another way: if the coverage is lower than total, then\nassume there are things that will go south (the famous \"code without\ntests is broken by design\"). If everything is covered, then for\ninterpreted languages (like Python), it means something like \"it\ncompiles\". It's syntactically correct, which doesn't mean it's\nsemantically correct. For compiled languages, here I see little gain,\nexcept for the mere fact that checks at a very basic level that the code\nwill run.\nA high coverage is not enough\nThere is another interesting idea about coverage, nicely illustrated in\nthe paper \"how to misuse tests coverage\"3, which is that code\ncoverage can only tell about the code that is there. Therefore, it\ncan't tell anything about potential bugs that due to missing code. It\ncan't detect faults of omission.\nOn the other hand, if instead of being just guided by the test coverage,\nwe actually think about the test scenarios that are relevant for a unit\nof code, we'll start thinking on new possibilities, inputs, and\ncombinations that will logically lead to these faults being discovered,\nand as a result of that, the corrective code will be included. This is\nthe key point: not just to settle for a high coverage, but for having a\nbattery of meaningful tests that cover relevant scenarios, instead of\nlines of code.\n\n\n    \n\n\n\n     Note \n    \n        Cover scenarios, not lines of code.\n    \n\nThe truth is that software is complex. Really complex. There are a lot\nof things that can go wrong. Therefore, tests are a fundamental tool to\nat least ensure a degree of quality. It is logical to think that for\neach line of code there should be many more of tests. This applies for\nall projects, in all programming languages. Now, if for each function we\nshould have at least many more of them just testing it, you'll quickly\nget the picture that the relation between productive code and testing\ncode should be in the ratio 1:N. Now, having 100% coverage (to say the\nbest), can only mean an 1:1 ratio. It could be the case of a single\ntest, covering the function, but not will sufficient cases.\nRelation between tests and main code\nLet's take a look at SQLite, which is a project that seems to have a\nreasonable level of testing4. According to the document that explains\nit's testing strategy, we can see that it has many more lines of tests\ncode than main code in the library.\nTo quote the document itself: the library contains roughly 122\nKLOC5, whereas the tests are about 91,596.1 KLOC (~90M LOC).\nThe ratio is an impressive 745x.\nIn my opinion, this relation does not only apply to C projects, it's\nsomething general to all programming languages. It's just the reality\nof software. This is what it takes to build reliable software.\nNow, with this idea in mind, knowing that we must have many more lines\nof testing code than productive code, because each possible function can\nhave multiple outcomes, and has to be exercised under multiple scenarios\n(validation of input, combination of its internal conditions, and more),\nit becomes clear, that coverage does not mean that the code is\nthoughtfully tested at all. It then becomes evident that coverage is not\nthe end, but the beginning of testing: once we've identified the lines\nthat need to be checked, the tests won't stop once they've been\ncovered, they should stop once all possible scenarios have been properly\nverified. It also becomes evident that is expected to have many more\ntimes testing lines than main ones.\n\n\n\n\n     Note \n    \n        Don't rely on coverage. Rely on thorough testing.\n    \n\nSlides\nThis idea was presented in a lightning talk at EuroPython\n2017, on Monday 10 of July.

Nygard\nMy rating: 5 of 5 stars\nIt's a fantastic book about good software engineering from non-traditional viewpoints.It takes another\napproach on good practices of software architecture: it considers more than just classic quality attributes, and it\nmakes you think you to architect your system in a way that's not only reliable and with good quality, but also easy to\noperate with. Concepts such as evolutionary architecture, adaptable architecture are reivewed throughout the chapters on\nthe last section. In particular I enjoyed to read more about how to make the architecture easy to build and integrate\ncontinuously, deploy it safely to production, and make changes on it (because, of course, \"change is the defining\ncharacteristic of software\"). It finishes with a great introduction to chaos engineering.It\ncovers all important topics on good software architecture: stability patterns, deployability, security, how to avoid\ntypical errors (like cascading failures, and what to do in such scenarios), 12-factor app, and more.I really\nliked the concept of cynical software: rather than assuming everything is going to be fine, ask what could\npossible go wrong, and expect (and be prepared to) the software to fail. Failures will inevitable occur, and we have to\nthink what to do about it.As an experienced software engineering practitioner, it was highly enjoyable for\nme to read the case studies presented, as their analysis and conclusions were deeply enlightening.All in\nall, a fantastic read, which gave me a lot of food for tought, and lots of materials and references to follow up on!\n\nView all my reviews\n","id":"https://rmariano.eu/book-review-release-it/","title":"Book Review: Release It!"},"https://rmariano.eu/checking-python-files-with-vim/":{"body":"Vim is an excellent editor, and mastering it leads to more productivity.\nEven though is very extensible and allows to be configured by many\nplug-ins I rather keep it as simple as possible, trying not to use many\nplug-ins (neither packagers like Vundle, etc.).\nHowever, I do make use of an extension that checks Python files for\nerrors, PEP8, among other things:\nflake8.

Read on. That seemingly obvious\nstatement is not actually what I mean.\nI'm not talking about a specific programming language. I'm talking\nabout coding as a practice in general. We're used to understanding\ncommon languages, from informal ones (like human languages such as\nEnglish or Spanish), to more formal or restrictive ones (like math).\nBut all in all, a language is anything you can use to express ideas\nwith. In that sense art is also a language: for a musician music would\nbe his/her language, painting, and so on. For expert chess players, the\nrules of chess would constitute a language.\nAnd even when something like this seems obvious (as stated at the\nbeginning), some people in the software industry sometimes fail to\nrecognize the coding activity as a language on itself.\nTo give an example: let's say you have to communicate an idea about\nsomething you want to implement. You can write a perfectly crafted\ndesign document (with architecture diagrams, and such), and then send it\nfor review. But is that really the best way to communicate a change? In\norder words, is it the best language to use when you want to get an idea\nacross?\nHow about publishing a code review instead? Sometimes instead of just\nsaying 'it would be good for your tool to do X', it's way more\nefficient, to just go ahead and implement it.\nIn other cases, a design document might not even be the best suitable\nlanguage choice to communicate your idea. In the case of a prototype, I\nwould be more confident on seeing actual working code. The same applies\nfor a proof-of-concept. A text document, or presentation slides would\nalways compile and make sense from a high-level perspective. But there\nare certain things that you won't find out until you dive deep into\nthe task, and that's when coding becomes a more effective communication\ntool.\nAfter all, the purpose of a pull request is not to merge code into the\nmain branch. It's to communicate an idea using code. When you submit a\nnew pull request you're communicating something. That something,\ndoesn't necessarily need to get merged.\nThis changes the definition of success for pull requests. Most would\nargue that a code review is successful if it gets merged without causing\nissues in production. This makes sense, of course, but it's also\nlimiting. If instead we'd say that a pull request is successful if it\neffectively communicates an idea, this would bring more value. You can\nhave a first code review submitted only to present a proof of concept.\nThe code could be scrappy and by no means anywhere near what the code\nbase would consider acceptable. But it will be something more concrete\nto communicate what (and how!) is you're trying to achieve. This can be\nreferenced in mails, or other docs, and then the team can go ahead with\nthe real (and high-quality) implementation.

The post was very\ninteresting, but what's more, it suggested an alternative idiom for\ncopying strings in C, that might probably be the way to go.\nLater, in another article2 that compared some functionality in C,\nPython and Go, one of the comments pointed out that very same idiom.\nThat grabbed my attention, so I decided to try it in an example.\nThe problem with strncpy seems to be the way it manages the source\nstring to be copied. Based on the sample code provided in the\ndocumentation3 (that should be just a reference), the break condition\nis up to n characters (the third parameter) or until the source string\nis exhausted, whatever happens first. This should not be a problem,\nunless n &lt; strlen(source_string). That parameter would make strncpy\nto finish before it can put a \\0 character at the end of the target\nstring, leaving an invalid array of characters4.\nThis is an example.\n\nOn this example, the target array is represented by the variable dst,\nand I used a fixed-length string, on purpose for the demonstration,\nsimulating what would actually happen. I null-terminated it so the\nprogram can finish successfully, because otherwise the operations on it\nwould not end until the delimiter is reached, and we cannot know when\nthat will happen, considering what's in memory at that time. In\naddition, the unpredictable behaviour will lead to errors, and probably\nto memory corruption. The underscore, should be interpreted as slots:\nregions or reserved memory that are there, but empty.\nThe proposed idiom uses strncat (see5), tricking the function by\npassing it an empty string as the first parameter, and then the actual\nstring we need to copy. This call will render the same result, but\nwithout the previous side effect. Let's see an example:\n\nHere we see, the error is no longer present, probably because of the\ndifference on the implementation (the snippet on the documentation6\ngives us a hint on what it does, so we can spot the change).\nThis might seem as a little issue, but it raised some concerns on the\nLinux kernel development, at the point that a new function was\ndeveloped. The strscpy function is being included in the Kernel\ndevelopment for Linux 4.3-rc47 because it is a better interface.\nSome of the problems mentioned in the commit message, that inspired this\nnew version, are the ones described on the previous paragraphs.\nThis makes me wonder, if this should be the \"correct\" way for\nperforming this operation \"safely\" in C. In all cases, the error is\nthe same (not checking the boundaries, and trusting the input), and\nshould be avoided. What I mean by this, is that we cannot simply rely on\nthose functions being secure, the security must be in our code, so the\nproper way to handle these situations is to code defensively: do not\ntrust user input, always check the boundaries, error codes, memory\nallocation, status of the pointer (a free for every malloc but not\nfor a NULL pointer, etc.).\n1\nhttps://the-flat-trantor-society.blogspot.com.ar/2012/03/no-strncpy-is-not-safer-strcpy.html.\n\n2\nhttps://blog.surgut.co.uk/2015/08/go-enjoy-python3.html.\n\n3\nstrncpy documentation.\n\n4\nAn array of characters that is not null-terminated, is invalid.\n\n5\nstrncat manual page.\n\n6\nstrncat manual page.\n\n7\nhttps://git.kernel.org/cgit/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/?id=30c44659f4a3e7e1f9f47e895591b4b40bf62671.\n\n","id":"https://rmariano.eu/copying-strings-in-c/","title":"strncpy and strncat for copying strings in C"},"https://rmariano.eu/default-arguments-in-python-functions/":{"body":"This post is based on a gist I wrote a while ago, about why is not a\ngood idea to pass default mutable objects as parameters in python\nfunction definitions.\nWhile the gist is explained through an example that uses lists, the\nprinciple is applicable to all sorts of objects (dictionaries, sets,\netc.).\n\nIf you are an experienced python developer, you probably knew this\ncaveat, nevertheless is something interesting to show to new python\ndevelopers, and to remember even if you have been writing code in Python\nfor years.\n","id":"https://rmariano.eu/default-arguments-in-python-functions/","title":"Default arguments in Python functions"},"https://rmariano.eu/deleting-commented-out-code/":{"body":"This is a rule I always encourage in software development. Moreover, I\nconsider it to be something that has to be included in every coding\nguideline of a good project.\nThere are several reasons for this, but probably the best explanation\ncan be found in the book \"Clean Code\"1 by uncle Bob, on which\nexplains that the code, gets outdated (rotten) with the rest of the\nsurrounding code, and hence it makes a place for confusion, leading to\nan error-prone spot.\nThere are, however, people that seem to find some arguments for\ncommenting out code, or leaving it. Some common arguments/reasons\nusually are:\n\n\n\"I might need this functionality later..\"\n\nWe have source control systems (for example git) for this. In git,\nanything can be restored from a previous point. If the software is\nproperly under version control, there is no reason to fear data loss.\nTrust git, code fearlessly.\n\n\"This is temporary disabled... It will be restored later\".\n\nAgain, same principle, rely on the version control system. Save a\npatch, and then restore later, or stash the changes, revert the\ncommit, etc. As you see, there are plenty of better options for\nsolving this scenario.\n\nCode that was left from the fist version\n\nProbably debugging leftovers. No doubt here: seek, locate, destroy.\n\nThere is, a clear problem with code that is under comment, which is that\nit is \"frozen\" in time: it was good at some point, but then it was\nleft there while the rest of the code around it, evolved, so this old\ncode might not certainly work (hence it is \"rotten\"), so un-commenting\nit is a bad idea because it will probably crash.\nAnother problem is that it can be a source of bias for some other\ndeveloper, who wants to maintain that code at a future point in time.\nThe one who left the rotten code, might have thought that it was a\nsource of inspiration for when this functionality was going to be\napplied, but instead, it is just biasing the new developer with this\nskeleton, preventing from a brand new, fresh idea for that code.\nTherefore, for these main reasons (an probably much more), having code\nthat is commented in a code base, is a poor practice, (not to mention a\ncode smell). If you are a seasoned developer, who cares about code\nquality, and best practices, you must not doubt when deleting it.

Let's see how we can write better decorators, by using\ndescriptors.\nDecorate a class method\nImagine we have a very simple decorator, that does nothing but returning\na text, with what the original function returns:\n\nIf we apply the decorator to a simple function, it'll work, as\nexpected. However, when it's applied to a class method, we can see an\nerror:\n\nThe exception is telling us that we tried to call something that is not\nactually a callable. But if that's the case then, how do class methods\nrun?\nThe fact is that, this is true, class methods are indeed not callable\nobjects, but we rarely notice this, because when we access a class\nmethod, it's usually in the form of\n&lt;class&gt;.&lt;class_method&gt; (or maybe also from an instance\ndoing self.&lt;class_method&gt;). For both cases the answer is the same: by\ncalling the method like this, the descriptor mechanism is triggered,\nand will call the __get__ inside the class method. As we already know\nfrom the analysis of the types-of-descriptors, @classmethod is actually a descriptor, and the definition\nof its __get__ method is the one that returns a callable1, but\n@classmethod is not itself a callable.\n\nHINT\n@classmethod is not a callable object. It's a descriptor whose\n__get__ method returns a callable.\n\nNow, when the decorator is applied to the class method, this is\nequivalent of doing:\n\nWhich doesn't trigger the descriptor protocol, so the __get__ in\n@classmethod is never called, therefore what the decorator receives,\nis not a callable, hence the exception.\nBy now, it becomes clear that if the reason why it fails is because\n@classmethod is a non-callable descriptor, then the solution must be\nrelated to descriptors. And indeed, this can be fixed by just\nimplementing __get__.\n\nThis links the function of the descriptor to the object that is going to\nuse it (in this case, the class), and returns a new instance of the\ndecorator for this function, which does the trick.\nIt's important to notice that this error was due to the order on which\ndescriptors where applied, because @decorator was decorating\n@classmethod and not the other way around. This problem wouldn't have\noccurred if we swapped the order of the decorators. So it's a fair\nquestion to ask, why wasn't this just applied like this to begin with?\nAfter all, a class method-like functionality is orthogonal from every\nother sort of decoration we might want to apply, so it makes sense to be\nit the last one being applied. True, but the fix is rather simple, and\nmore importantly, it makes the decorator more generic and applicable, as\nit's shown on the next section.\n\nNOTE\nKeep in mind the order of the decorators, and make sure @classmethod\nis the last one being used, in order to avoid issues. Even despite this\nconsideration, is better to have decorators that will work in many\npossible scenarios, regardless of their order.\n\nThe complete code for this example can be found\nhere\nDecorators that change the signature\nScenario: Several parts of the code have callable objects that interact\nwith their parameters in the same way, resulting in code repetition. As\na result of that, a decorator is devised in order to abstract that logic\nin a single place.\nFor example, we have a function that resolves some attributes based on\nits parameters, but it does so, by using a helper object, created from\nthe parameters, like this:\n\nIf there are more functions with this signature doing the same as in the\nfirst lines, it'll be better to abstract this away, and simply receive\nthe helper object directly. A decorator like this one should work:\n\nThis decorator changes the signature of the original function.\nTherefore, we decorate a function that will receive a single argument,\nwhen in fact (thanks to the decorator), the resulting one will end up\nreceiving the same old four arguments, maintaining compatibility. By\napplying the decorator, we could happily assume that the required object\nwill be passed by:\n\nHowever, there are also objects whose methods have this logic, and we\nwant to apply the same decorator to them:\n\nBut with this implementation, it won't work:\n\nThe problem is that instance methods are functions, that take an extra\nfirst parameter, namely self, which is the instance itself. In this\ncase, the error shown in line 41, means that the decorator is composing\nthe object as usually, and passes it was the first parameter, in the\nplace where self would go for the method, and there is nothing being\npassed for helper (the parameters are \"shifted\" on place to the\nleft), hence the error.\nIn order to fix this, we need to distinguish when the wrapped function\nis being called from an instance or a class. And descriptors do just\nthat, so the fix is rather simple as in the previous case:\n\nThe same method works here as well. When the wrapped function is a\nregular one, the __get__ method doesn't take place at all, so adding\nit, doesn't affect the decorator. Whereas, when is called from a class,\nthe __get__ method is enabled, returning a bound instance, which will\npass self as the first parameter (what Python does internally).\n\nHINT\nDescriptors can help writing better decorators, by fixing common\nproblems in a very elegant fashion.\n\nHere is the listing for\nthis example.\n1\nAn equivalent Python implementation of classmethod and others can\nbe found at\nhttps://docs.python.org/3.6/howto/descriptor.html#descriptor-protocol\n\n","id":"https://rmariano.eu/descriptors-decorators/","title":"Descriptors & Decorators"},"https://rmariano.eu/discovering-descriptors/":{"body":"This talk was presented at PyCon CZ 2017\nand EuroPython\n2017.\nHere are the references and resources for the presentation.\nThe code used for the talk, is available\nhere\nand contains some explanations along with the examples.\nSlides\n\nVideo\nThis is the recording of the talk presented at EuroPython\n2017.\n\n    \n    \nReferences\nTo learn more about descriptors, you could check some of the following\nreferences, used as base for the talk:\n\nFluent Python - by Luciano\nRamalho: This\nbook has a great cover of all topics of Python, and descriptors is\nno exception.

However, without losing pragmatism, in case there are some odd\nreasons why this might be acceptable, I will also mention them, if any.\nLet's see where we get.\n\n\nYou do not know what you get\nAn arbitrary Python script may contain any code, and most of it\nwill be executed when performing the import * part (you cannot rely on\nhow __name__ is handled). The interface is totally unclear: you do not\nknow what computations performs, what objects will import, etc. In\ngeneral is more efficient to import as few definitions as possible.\n\n\nIdentifiers appear magically\nIn any decently readable Python script, the programmer must be able to\nlocate every definition, which means to identify where does every identifier\ncome from. For example, a variable named x can either be a parameter of\nthe function in the current scope, a variable already defined (assigned), or\na name already imported (from mod import x), etc. By performing the\nincorrect import, this variable might appear out of the blue, meaning that I\nwill have an x that will not be neither a parameter, nor a definition nor\na declared import. This means, I cannot track the origin or x. The\nsituation gets worse if there are not one, but many import * statements.\nDebugging becomes a nightmare.\n\n\nNamespaces are one honking great idea -- let's do more of those!\nStraight from the Python zen1. By importing everything from a module, the\nbenefits of the namespaces are somehow lost.  Instead, everything (or a lot\nof things), might get to be called the same, messing with the current scope.\nMoreover, new import definitions might override previous ones.\n\n\nExplicit is better than implicit\nAgain, every identifier that we want imported should be done explicitly (the\n* is not very declarative).\n\n\nNow, so far these might be some of the main reasons about why importing\neverything from a Python module is usually not a good idea. However, in\ncase the code at stake is just a simple testing script, or an in-line\nsentence on ipython, there could be nothing wrong about it.\nIn addition, although I am not a big fan of import statements inside\nfunctions (sometimes they are necessary, though), importing everything\nfrom a package within a function is not a big problem, because the scope\nis already narrowed.\nJust to be clear, this is by no means an absolute statement, but an idea\npresented in order to write better code. One of the things I like the\nmost about Python is that encourages good practices. Therefore, if I\nread an import statement like this, unless there are some very good\nreasons to do so, I will think that line as a code-smell2.\n1\nimport this\n\n2\nhttps://c2.com/cgi/wiki?CodeSmell\n\n","id":"https://rmariano.eu/do-not-import/","title":"Do not import *"},"https://rmariano.eu/europython-2016-remarks/":{"body":"Last week, EuroPython 2016 finished, and it was an amazing conference I\nhad the pleasure to attend. Here is my review of those days.\nThe conference\nI arrived on Saturday noon at Bilbao, Spain, the day before the\nconference, so I had some time to know the city, see the venues, etc.\nThe next day, on Sunday, was for two separate workshops: Django girls\nand Beginner's day. I attended the beginner's day as a coach, and\nhelped a group of intermediate developers with several exercises aimed\nat explaining some Python concepts, such as: context managers,\ndecorators, magic methods, generators, etc. It was really curious that\nsome of these topics were those I was going to cover on my talk on\nWednesday, so I felt really glad about that. I took an oath (very funny\nBTW) for becoming a beginner's mentor, and so I did (it was really good\nactually). I had a great time helping other developers, exchanging ideas\nand experiences during lunch, solving problems, and getting a first\nglimpse on what the conference was going to be like.\n\n\nAfter the workshop finished, I walked to the main venue, and gave a hand\npacking the bags of the conference. After that, time to see around\nBilbao.\nFrom Monday to Friday was the conference itself, with all the talks, and\ntrainings.\nMonday started with the introduction to the conference, and shortly\nthereafter, the very first keynote by Rachel Willmer, who gave a great\npresentation, sharing a lot of experience, and interesting ideas.\nAt around noon there was a keynote by N. Tollervey about MicroPython.\nThe presentation was excellent (one of the ones I liked the most), and\nthe idea of the project is awesome. On top of that, it was announced\nthat the BBC was giving away\nmicro:bits for the attendees\nof the conference, so it was a great surprise to pick up mine at the\nconference desk. I even started playing around a bit with it (more in a\nfuture post).\nThe rest of the afternoon, I attended several talks. At the end, there\nwere, of course the lightning talks, which were amazing.\nTuesday started with the keynote by P. Hildebrant, presenting how Disney\nuses several technologies, including Python, as support for movies and\nproductions. It was very good and enlightening to see an endeavour of\nsuch extent with Python. After that, during morning I attended a\nworkshop about Async web development, with several Python technologies\nfor doing asynchronous\ncomputation.\nDuring the afternoon, I watched several great talks, including \"Protect\nyou users with Circuit Breakers\", and several other good ones, closing\nwith the lightning talks.\nWednesday was the day of my talk, so I attended some talks during\nmorning and then, at the afternoon, I presented mine. I really liked how\nit developed. Moreover, it was really good to receive good feedback from\nsome attendees, saying they liked it, and that it was useful for them.\nShortly thereafter, I published the slides and the source code.\nOn Thursday, there were some talks about async/await and asynchronous\nprogramming in Python 3, mocks, and high-availability architecture.\nOn Friday, the keynote was about how Python is used by the scientific\ncommunity. It was very enlightening, and interesting to see another use\ncase of Python, and how is becoming the main technology on this area.\nThe talks during morning in this case, were divided among several\ntopics, being the main ones: instrumentation for performance metrics,\n\"How to migrate form PostgreSQL to HDF5 and live happily ever after\",\n\"Split Up! Fighting the monolith\". During the afternoon, I joined a\nworkshop about Docker, on which we built an application using\nDocker-combine, and followed good practices.\nIt is worth mentioning, that on Friday there was an special edition for\nlightning talks, which was not in the original schedule. After making\nsome arrangements, and due to some on-the-fly changes, it was possible\nto have another session for lightning talks, right before the sprints\norientation and the closing session.\nSaturday and Sunday were for sprints (hackathons). On Saturday I joined\nto sprint on aiohttp, and actually submitted a pull\nrequest, that was merged,\nwhereas on Sunday I wanted to check on a pytest issue.\nSprints @europython! pic.twitter.com/PVQZw9rSvV— PySS Society (@acpyss) July 23, 2016 \nMy talk\nIt was great to have the opportunity to present at EuroPython. What was\neven better, was the positive feedback I got from other attendees, and\nthe fact that it was useful and interesting for them (which was, in the\nend, what I cared most about). I found the experience very positive.\nFrom the comments, I gathered something I have not noticed when I first\nenvisioned the talk, which is how useful these concepts might be for\npeople using Python for scientific applications. It seems, scientists\nusing Python for data processing or computation, do not usually have the\nbackground of a developer, so concepts like code readability, technical\ndebt, and maintainability, are helpful in order to improve the code\nbase. This gave me the idea of adapting the examples, perhaps adding one\nrelated to these areas.\nPython use cases\nThere were people from many countries, industries, and companies with\ndifferent backgrounds. The trend seems to be now on data science, but\nPython is widely used in many areas.\nI believe the main areas of focus for Python are: software development,\nsystem administration / Dev Ops, and science.\nThere were talks, tracks, sessions, and trainings for all of them, with\nvery technical detail.\nHighlights\nThere were so many great talks and resources that I cannot name each\nsingle one of them, so I will point the main topics and some of the\ntalks that grabbed my attention the most, but please keep in mind that\nall were great.\nAmong the many things pending to test and research, are also books. I\nlearned about PYRO4, for managing Python remote objects, which seems\nlike a promising technology. I will dive into more detail on conda and\nthe building systems, conda channels, etc. The talk \"Exploring your\nPython interpreter\" was really interesting, and it was a good\nintroduction, in order to become involved with CPython development.\nI attended many talks about the latest features of Python 3.5, such as\nasyncIO, coroutines, and all the new functionalities for asynchronous\nprogramming, and they all were really interesting. In particular \"The\nreport of Twisted's Death\" was very interesting, and (spoiler alert),\nit looks like still has an interesting future competing with the new\nlibraries and standards.\nOn the lightning talks, it was presented a reverse debugger (revdb), and\nits demo was amazing.\nConclusion\nAfter attending many talks, and trainings, talking to many other\nexperience developers, system administrators, and data scientists, I can\nstate that the conference has an amazing learning environment, and the\noutcome was completely positive. It was useful for catching up with\ntechnology, checking the environment and see how Python is being used or\ndeployed in the wild, learn from use cases, experiences, and exchange\nideas.\nThe content was really inspiring and open-minding. I have lots of items\nto check, as points for research, which I will cover in following\nentries.\nPython 3 is much more widely used than one would expect. It is actually\nthe standard now, and many talks (including mine), were using Python 3\ncode, but most importantly, most projects are now in this version,\nwhereas Python 2 looks like the legacy option.

It was another great\nopportunity to share knowledge and experience about Python.\nIn particular this time I was lucky enough to work with a group of\nmathematicians who used Python for data science, so I learnt about these\nconcepts, and we worked a bit with Pandas for processing numbers.\nDay 1: Monday\nThe day the conference officially started with the first announcements.\nAfter that, the first keynote was delivered: A Python for future\ngenerations. I personally really enjoyed this talk because it covered\nmany important aspects of Python, mainly those areas where the language\nstill has to evolve (packaging, defining dependencies and requirements\nfor large projects, and so on).\nI found this keynote to be absolute amazing. The speaker, a well-known\nexpert in the community, pointed out really important points on the\npresent of Python, that will have a significant impact on its future.\nThe main points as I recall them (again the talk is thoroughly great, so\nit's totally worth it to watch it entirely), are:\n\nPackaging has improved but it still needs polishing (many tools like\npip, setuptools, wheels, and more, they all patch internals of\nPython in order to work). There should be something like the\npackage.json for JavaScript/NodeJS applications.\nCFFI is the way to go. Developing C extensions is not a good\nidea.\nThe most realistic way of getting rid of the GIL is by breaking\nbackwards compatibility on C extensions. And we should.\n... Speaking of which Python didn't do very well on backwards\ncompatibility, because there has been enormous efforts in order to\npreserve them, when maybe there should have not been. And the one\ntime it was (for Python 3), the community didn't take it very well.\nPython developers should be more receptive to new changes, and\naccept that things change and they're going to breack, as it\nhappens on many other languages.\nThe Unicode implementation on CPython is not very good. Fixing this\nmight mean breaking some backwards compatibility (for example,\nremoving slicing on strings).\nOther implementations of Python (pypy, for instance), try to mimic\nthe behaviour of CPython, leading to issues or hacks that could be\navoided that could be avoided just by accepting that they are not\n100% compatible (and making clear so).\nThe source code of CPython is very readable, which makes it very\nclear to get an idea of what is going on production.\n\nThe next talk I attended to was Protocols and Practices enforcing in\nPython through bytecode and inspection. It was fine, and I got the idea\nof using inspection in order to code defensively, and make your library\nmore robust, failing quickly when users try to use the API in unexpected\nways.\nOn the same room followed \"2 + 2 = 5: Monkey-patching CPython with\nctypes to conform to Party doctrine\". The value of this talk was\nreally good in the sense that the path it took left lots of learning\npoints along the way. It was a technical talk exploring some internals\nof CPython, how it loads variables, optimizations of the interpreters,\ncontext, and more.\nNext talk, titled \"But how do you know your mock is valid? Verified\nfakes of web services\", presented good examples of mocking and\ntesting, with tips good practices and recommendations.\nAnother of the key points of the day was Debugging in Python 3.6:\nBetter, Faster, Stronger. This talk was really interesting beause it\nexplained how new additions proposed on PEP-5231 applied in\nPython 3.6, make it much easier to debug and inspect in frames. It\nalso compared several tracing strategies used by loggers, showing their\ndifferences on performance.\nThe last talk of the day was Async Web Apps with Sanic, that shown\nexamples of this application server.\nThen there was time for the lightning talks. I presented one about code\ncoverage titled beyond-coverage{.interpreted-text role=\"doc\"}.\nDuring this time it was announced that there were two free slots for\ntalks, so I volunteered to fill in one of the gaps, for Tuesday at\n15:45, on a 30' slot.\nThat meant next day, was a talk day.\nDay 2: Tuesday\nTalk day!\nWell, not just yet. First I listened to the keynote, How to create\ninspiring data visualizations?. After that I listened to Solid\nSnakes, a talk I knew it was presented at PyCon US (like the one\nabout debugging in Python 3.6). It was really good, one of the best\npoints of the day.\nThen, on the afternoon, it was time for my talk called\ndiscovering-descriptors{.interpreted-text role=\"doc\"}. I liked the way\nit panned out, and I was asked interesting questions by the audience,\nwho also gave me good feedback. It's an interesting topic, that I'm\nglad I presented.\nI finished the day by listeing to the talk about Django and GraphQL,\nwhich is an interesting and trendy technology. Afterwards, it was time\nfor lightning talks, which are always great.\nDay 3: Wednesday\nThis day also started with another amazing keynote, this time it was If\nEthics is not None. I always enjoy talks that recap the history of\ncomputing, highlighting the milestones, but this one in particular also\nleft me with lots of items to investigate, so I really enjoyed it.\nThe rest of the morning was spent on the training for optimizing code\nwith Cython. I will cover this topic as part of performance\nimprovements and analysis in the future.\nOn the afternoon, there were two great talks Green threads in Python\n(which was about a super interesting topic, presented in a really good\nway), and Sustainable Scientific Software Development, which was\nabsolutely awesome. The latter, made the day, because it was an analysis\nof software engineering principles (tests, continuous integrations, good\npractices), applied to science, in a way of \"enforcing\" these\npractices on scientific research.\nThat was basically half-way through EuroPython 2017. So far, it's\nbeing an amazing experience.

This helps to minimize the effect of bug reproducibility, when\nhaving multiples environments, specially for projects that rely heavily\non the infrastructure (if they have OS-level dependencies, like\nlibraries installed, and so on).\nThese talks were really good, but I think the highlight of the day was\nOptimizing queries for not so big data in PostgreSQL, which actually\npresented several ways of optimizing queries on PostgreSQL, as well as\ntips in order to identify bottlenecks, and performance issues. I liked\nthe fact that it had a more concrete approach to performance tuning in\ndatabases, and even though it was explained for a large data set, it\nstill didn't make it \"Big Data\", so it was a more down-to-earth\nexplanation with real examples, and that added a lot of value.\nLater on the day, after the talks, there was a session for sprints\norientation, on which all leads briefly explained the projects they\nwould be sprinting on. I have arrived with the expectations of sprinting\non CPython, but it wasn't presented, and among all presented projects\nthe one I got most interested in was pypy. At that point I decided I\nwas going to sprint on pypy.\nFriday\nThe keynote for Friday, The Encounter: Python's adventures in Africa,\nwas mind-blowing. It enlightened many of us in the audience, about\nissues we probably haven't even considered before, about Python in a\nmuch broader sense as just a programming language, discussing it in the\ncontext of the role of technology and innovation in the present day.\nFollowing up with the talks Finding bugs for free: The magic of static\nanalysis, was a really nice one. Afterwards there was even an open\nsession, on which we discussed the topic further, on a more concrete\nfashion (by seeing static analysis being done on actual projects,\nthrough the tool lgtm).\nThe last two talks of the morning Practical Debugging - Tips, Tricks\nand Ways to think, and Pythonic Refactoring: Protecting Your Users\nFrom Change, had nice examples, which left me with the idea of\nexploring some of those examples a bit more. In particular the latter\none, mentioned some common patterns in Python for evolving code that is\nalready published under an API. I will cover some of these ideas in a\nfuture post.\nI attended one last talk, Writing Awesome PyPI packages in Python,\nbefore the lightning talks and closing session.\nThat was the end of the week for talks, and workshops, so the remaining\ntime was for sprints.\nSprints\nSaturday: As expected, I joined the pypy project. It was a great\nexperience to code along so many great (really great) developers. After\na while of setting things up (cloning the repository, getting acquainted\nwith the code, planning, and such), I mentioned that it would be\ninteresting to work on things that are still pending for the\nPython 3.6 support. With the help of the developers we ported some\nmissing features added on the last version of Python (adding fspath\nfunction to the posix -- os module, including the new\nModuleNotFoundError, and things like that). It was highly productive,\nand things seemed to work nicely.\nSunday: Another day to sprint on pypy! This time, we pair-programmed\ninto trying to port the asyncio functionality. Part of this was being\ndone the day before (I didn't took that much of part, as I was starting\nwith the other issues -- but this time I wanted to contribute). It was\nbasically trying to fix the way asynchronous generators work on several\nscenarios (when calling different methods on them, like .asend(),\n.athrow(), etc.). Here I mainly added unit tests for these scenarios,\nin order to check that pypy works the same as CPython for some of\nthese common scenarios (which are still not fully covered, but a great\nprogress was made).\nI really liked the progress made on pypy, and the project itself. By\ncoding these issues, I learnt a lot about CPython itself, more to the\npoint of its internal components, and how things work. It was an awesome\nsprint. Stay tuned for more information abut changes on pypy.\n","id":"https://rmariano.eu/europython-2017-second-part/","title":"EuroPython 2017 - second part"},"https://rmariano.eu/exploring-generators-and-coroutines/":{"body":"Let's revisit the idea of generators in Python, in order to understand\nhow the support for coroutines was achieved in latest versions of Python\n(3.6, at the time of this writing).\nBy reviewing the milestones on generators, chronologically, we can get a\nbetter idea of the evolution that lead to asynchronous programming in\nPython.\nWe will review the main changes in Python that relate to generators and\nasynchronous programming, starting with\nPEP-255 (Simple\nGenerators), PEP-342\n(Coroutines via Enhanced Generators),\nPEP-380 (Syntax for\ndelegating to a Sub-Generator), and finishing with\nPEP-525 (Asynchronous\nGenerators).\nSimple Generators\nPEP-255 introduced generators to Python. The idea is that when we\nprocess some data, we don't actually need all of that to be in memory\nat once. Most of the times, having one value at the time is enough. Lazy\nevaluation is a good trait to have in software, because in this case it\nmeans that less memory is used. It's also a key concept in other\nprogramming languages, and one of the main ideas behind functional\nprogramming.\nThe new yield keyword was added to Python, with the meaning of\nproducing an element that will be consumed by another caller function.\nThe mere presence of the yield keyword on any part of the function,\nautomatically makes that a generator function. When called, this\nfunction will create a generator object, which can be advanced,\nproducing its elements, one at the time. By calling the generator\nsuccessive times with the next() function, the generator advances to\nthe next yield statement, producing values. After the generator\nproduced a value, the generator is suspended, waiting to be called\nagain.\nTake the [range]{.title-ref} built-in function, for example. In Python\n2, this function returns a list with all the numbers on the interval.\nImagine we want to come up with a similar implementation of it, in order\nto get the sum of all numbers up to a certain limit.\n\nNow let's see how much memory is used:\n\nThe first number is the result of the print, whilst the second one is\nthe output of the [time]{.title-ref} command, printing out the memory\nused by the program (~48 MiB).\nNow, what if this is implemented with a generator instead?\nWe just have to get rid of the list, and place the [yield]{.title-ref}\nstatement instead, indicating that we want to produce the value on the\nexpression that follows the keyword.\n\nThis time, the result is:\n\nWe see a huge difference: the implementation that holds all numbers in a\nlist in memory, uses ~48MiB, whereas the implementation that just uses\none number at the time, uses much less memory (&lt; 9 MiB)1.\nWe see the idea: when the [yield &lt;expression&gt;]{.title-ref} is reached,\nthe result of the expression will be passed to the caller code, and the\ngenerator will remain suspended at that line in the meanwhile.\n\nGenerators are iterable objects. An iterable is an object whose\n__iter__ method, constructs a new iterator, every time is called\n(with iter(it), for instance). An iterator is an object whose\n__iter__ returns itself, and its __next__ method contains the logic\nto produce new values each time is called, and how to signal the stop\n(by raising StopIteration).\nThe idea of iterables is that they advance through values, by calling\nthe built-in next() function on it, and this will produce values until\nthe StopIteration exception is raised, signalling the end of the\niteration.\n\nIn the first case, when calling f(), this creates a new generator. The\nfirst two calls to next(), will advance until the next yield\nstatement, producing the values they have set. When there is nothing\nelse to produce, the StopIteration exception is raised. Something\nsimilar to this, is actually run, when we iterate over this object in\nthe form of [for x in iterable: ...]{.title-ref}. Only that Python\ninternally handles the exception that determines when the for loop\nstops.\nBefore wrapping up the introduction to generators, I want to make a\nquick comment, and highlight something important about the role of\ngenerators in the language, and why they're such a neat abstraction to\nhave.\nInstead of using the eager version (the one that stores everything in a\nlist), you might consider avoiding that by just using a loop and\ncounting inside it. It's like saying \"all I need is just the count, so I\nmight as well just accumulate the value in a loop, and that's it\".\nSomething slightly similar to:\n\nThis is something I might consider doing in a language that doesn't\nhave generators. Don't do this. Generators are the right way to go. By\nusing a generator, we're doing more than just wrapping the code of an\niteration; we're creating a sequence (which could even be infinite), and\nnaming it. This sequence we have, is an object we can use in the rest of\nthe code. It's an abstraction. As such, we can combine it with the rest\nof the code (for example to filter on it), reuse it, pass it along to\nother objects, and more.\nFor example, let's say we have the sequence created with new_range(),\nand then we realize that we need the first 10 even numbers of it. This\nis as simple as doing.\n\nAnd this is something we could not so easily accomplish, had we chosen\nto ignore generators.\nFor years, this has been all pretty much about generators in Python.\nGenerators were introduced with the idea of iteration and lazy\ncomputation in mind.\nLater on, there was another enhancement, by PEP-342, adding more methods\nto them, with the goal of supporting coroutines.\nCoroutines\nRoughly speaking, the idea of coroutines is to pause the execution of a\nfunction at a given point, from where it can be later resumed. The idea\nis that while a coroutine is suspended, the program can switch to run\nanother part of the code. Basically, we need functions that can be\npaused.\nAs we have seen from the previous example, generators have this feature:\nwhen the yield &lt;expresson&gt;, is reached, a value is produced to the\ncaller object, and in the meantime the generator object is suspended.\nThis suggested that generators can be used to support coroutines in\nPython, hence the name of the PEP being \"Coroutines via Enhanced\nGenerators\".\nThere is more, though. Coroutines have to support to be resumed from\nmultiple entry points to continue their execution. Therefore, more\nchanges are required. We need to be able to pass data back to them, and\nhandle exceptions. For this, more methods were added to their interface.\n\nsend(&lt;value&gt;)\nthrow(ex_type[, ex_value[, ex_traceback]])\nclose()\n\nThese methods allow sending a value to a generator, throwing an\nexception inside it, and closing it, respectively.\nThe send() method implies that [yield]{.title-ref} becomes an\nexpression, rather than a statement (as it was before). With this,\nis possible to assign the result of a [yield]{.title-ref} to a variable,\nand the value will be whatever it was sent to it.\n\nAs we can see from this previous code, the value sent by yield is\ngoing to be the result of the send, (in this case, the consecutive\nnumbers of the sequence), while the value passed in the send(), the\nparameter, is the result that is assigned to value as returned by the\nyield, and printed out on the next line.\nBefore sending any values to the generator, this has to be advanced to\nthe next yield. In fact, advancing is the only allowed operation on a\nnewly-created generator. This can be done by calling next(g) or\ng.send(None), which are equivalent.\n\n[!WARNING]\nRemember to always advance a generator that was just created, or you\nwill get a TypeError\n\nWith the .throw() method the caller can make the generator raise an\nexception at the point where is suspended. If this exception is handled\ninternally in the generator, it will continue normally and the return\nvalue will be the one of the next yield line that reached. If it's\nnot handled by the generator, it will fail, and the exception will\npropagate to the caller.\nThe .close() method is used to terminate the generator. It will raise\nthe GeneratorExit exception inside the generator. If we wish to run\nsome clean up code, this is the exception to handle. When handling this\nexception, the only allowed action is to return a value.\nWith these additions, generators have now evolved into coroutines. This\nmeans our code can now support concurrent programming, suspend the\nexecution of tasks, compute non-blocking I/O, and such.\nWhile this works, handling many coroutines, refactor generators, and\norganizing the code became a bit cumbersome. More work had to be done,\nif we wanted to keep a Pythonic way of doing concurrent programming.\nMore Coroutines\nPEP-380 added more changes to coroutines, this time with the goal of\nsupporting delegation to sub-generators. Two main things changed in\ngenerators to make them more useful as coroutines:\n\nGenerators can now return values.\nThe yield from syntax.\n\nReturn Values in Generators\nThe keyword def, defines a function, which returns values (with the\nreturn keyword). However, as stated on the first section, if that\ndef contains a yield, is a generator function. Before this PEP it\nwould have been a syntax error to have a return in a generator\nfunction (a function that also has a yield. However, this is no longer\nthe case.\nRemember how generators stop by raising StopIteration. What does it\nmean that a generator returns a value? It means that it stops. And where\ndoes that value do? It's contained inside the exception, as an\nattribute in StopIteration.value.\n\nNotice that the value returned by the generator is stored inside the\nexception, in [StopIteration.value]{.title-ref}. This might sound like\nis not the most elegant solution, but doing so, preserves the original\ninterface, and the protocol remains unchanged. It's still the same kind\nof exception signalling the end of the iteration.\nyield from\nAnother syntax change to the language.\nIn its most basic form, the construction yield from &lt;iterable&gt;, can be\nthought of as:\n\nBasically this means that it extends an iterable, yielding all\nelements that this internal iterable can produce.\nFor example, this way we could create a clone of the itertools.chain\nfunction from the standard library.\n\nHowever, saving two lines of code is not the reason why this\nconstruction was added to the language. The raison d'etre of this\nconstruction is to actually delegate responsibility into smaller\ngenerators, and chain them.\n\nHere we see how yield from handles proper delegation to an internal\ngenerator. Notice that we never send values directly to internal, but\nto gen, instead, and these values end up on the nested generator. What\nyield from is actually doing is creating a generator that has a\nchannel to all nested generators. Values produced by these will be\nprovided to the caller of gen. Values sent to it, will be passed along\nto the internal generators (the same for exceptions). Even the return\nvalue is handled, and becomes the return value of the top-level\ngenerator (in this case the string that states the name of the last\ngenerator becomes the resulting StopIteration.value).\nWe see now the real value of this construction. With this, it's easier\nto refactor generators into smaller pieces, compose them and chain them\ntogether while preserving the behaviour of coroutines.\nThe new yield from syntax is a great step towards supporting better\nconcurrency. We can now think generators as being \"lightweight\nthreads\", that delegate functionality to an internal generator, pause\nthe execution, so that other things can be computed in that time.\nBecause syntactically generators are like coroutines, it was possible to\naccidentally confuse them, and end up placing a generator where a\ncoroutine would have been expected (the yield from would accept it,\nafter all). For this reason, the next step is to actually define the\nconcept of coroutine as a proper type. With this change, it also\nfollowed that yield from evolved into await, and a new syntax for\ndefining coroutines was introduced: async.\nasync def / await\nA quick note on how this relates to asynchronous programming in Python.\nOn asyncio, or any other event loop, the idea is that we define\ncoroutines, and make them part of the event loop. Broadly speaking the\nevent loop will keep a list of the tasks (which wrap our coroutines)\nthat have to run, and will schedule them to.\nOn our coroutines we delegate the I/O functionality we want to achieve,\nto some other coroutine or awaitable object, by calling yield from\nor await on it.\nThen the event loop will call our coroutine, which will reach this line,\ndelegating to the internal coroutine, and pausing the execution, which\ngives the control back to the scheduler (so it can run another\ncoroutine). The event loop will monitor the future object that wraps our\ncoroutine until is finished, and when it's needed, it will update it by\ncalling the .send() method on it. Which in turn, will pass along to\nthe internal coroutine, and so on.\nBefore the new syntax for async and await was introduced, coroutines\nwere defined as generators decorated with asyncio.coroutine\n(types.coroutine was added in Python 3.5, when the coroutine type\nitself was created). Nowadays, async def creates a native coroutine,\nand inside it, only the await expression is accepted (not\nyield from).\nThe following two coroutines step and coro are a simple example, of\nhow await works similar to yield from delegating the values to the\ninternal generator.\n\nOnce again, like in the yield from example, when we send a value to\ncoro, this reaches the await instruction, which means that will pass\nto the step coroutine. In this simple example coro is something like\nwhat we would write, while step would be an external function we call.\nThe following two coroutines are different ways of defining coroutines.\n\nBasically this means that this asynchronous way of programming is kind\nof like an API, for working with event loops. It doesn't really relate\nto asyncio, we could use any event loop (curio, uvloop, etc.), for\nthis. The important part is to understand, that an event loop will call\nour coroutine, which will eventually reach the line where we defined the\nawait, and this will delegate the function to an external function (in\nthis case asyncio.sleep). When the event loop calls send(), this is\nalso passed, and the await gives back control to the event loop, so a\ndifferent coroutine can run.\nThe coroutines we define are therefore in between the event loop, and\n3rd-party functions that know how to handle the I/O in a non-blocking\nfashion.\nThe event loop works then by a chain of await calls. Ultimately, at\nthe end of that chain there is a generator, that pauses the execution of\nthe function, and handles the I/O.\nIn fact if we check the type of asyncio.sleep, we'll see that is\nindeed a generator:\n\nSo with this new syntax, does this mean that await is like\nyield from?\nOnly with respect to coroutines. It's correct to write\nawait &lt;coroutine&gt;, as well as yield from &lt;coroutine&gt;, the former\nwon't work with other iterables (for example generators that aren't\ncoroutines, sequences, etc.). Conversely, the latter won't work with\nawaitable objects.\nThe reason for this syntax change is for correctness. Actually it's not\njust a syntax change, the new coroutine type is properly defined.:\n\nGiven that coroutines are syntactically like generators, it would be\npossible to mix them, and place a generator in an asynchronous code\nwhere in fact we expected a coroutine. By using await, the type of the\nobject in the expression is checked by Python, and if it doesn't\ncomply, it will raise an exception.\nAsynchronous Generators\nIn Python 3.5 not only the proper syntax for coroutines was added\n(async def / await), but also the concept of asynchronous iterators.\nThe idea of having an asynchronous iterable is to iterate while\nrunning asynchronous code. For this new methods such as __aiter__ and\n__anext__ where added under the concept of asynchronous iterators.\nHowever there was no support for asynchronous generators. That is\nanalogous to saying that for asynchronous code we had to use iterables\n(like __iter__ / __next__ on regular code), but we couldn't use\ngenerators (having a yield in an async def function was an error).\nThis changed in Python 3.6, and now this syntax is supported, with the\nsemantics of a regular generator (lazy evaluation, suspend and produce\none element at the time, etc.), while iterating.\nConsider this simple example on which we want to iterate while calling\nsome I/O code that we don't want to block upon.\n\nThe test function will simply exercise the iterator, on which elements\nare produced, one at the time, while calling an I/O task (in this\nexample asyncio.sleep).\nWith asynchronous generators, the same could be rewritten in a more\ncompact way.\n\nSummary\nIt all started with generators. It was a simple way of having lazy\ncomputation in Python, and running more efficient programs, that use\nless memory.\nThis evolved into coroutines, taking advantage of the fact that\ngenerators can suspend their execution. By extending the interface of\ngenerators, coroutines provided more powerful features to Python.\nCoroutines were also improved to support better patterns, and the\naddition of yield from was a game changer, that allows to have better\ngenerators, refactor into smaller pieces, and reorganize the logic\nbetter.\nThe addition of an event loop to the standard library, helps to provide\na referential way of doing asynchronous programming. However, the logic\nof the coroutines and the await syntax it not bound to any particular\nevent loop. It's an API2 for doing asynchronous programming.\nAsynchronous generator was the latest addition to Python that relates to\ngenerators, and they help build more compact (and efficient!) code for\nasynchronous iteration.\nIn the end, behind all the logic of async / await, everything is a\ngenerator. Coroutines are in fact (technically), generators.\nConceptually they are different, and have different purposes, but in\nterms of implementation generators are what make all this asynchronous\nprogramming possible.\nSlides\n\nReferences\n\nFluent Python - Luciano Ramalho: Chapters 14 &amp; 16\nhttps://snarky.ca/how-the-heck-does-async-await-work-in-python-3-5/\n\nNotes\n1\nNeedless to say, the results will vary from system to system, but\nwe get an idea of the difference between both implementations.\n\n2\nThis is an idea by David Beazley, that you can see at\nhttps://youtu.be/ZzfHjytDceU\n\n","id":"https://rmariano.eu/exploring-generators-and-coroutines/","title":"Exploring Generators and Coroutines"},"https://rmariano.eu/find-options/":{"body":"Among the core-utils, find is one of the most useful commands.

Here is a very simple example.\nImagine you have to move many files to a directory, but they all call\ndifferent so a\nglob is no use,\nand manually moving all of them is not an option.

It's a well-known good practice of software\nengineering to keep the business logic separated from external,\nuncontrolled dependencies (implementation details), yet something that\nkeeps on happening repeatedly. A design with an hexagonal architecture\naims to solve this problem, helping to achieve a clean architecture.\nThe main idea\nThe main idea behind the hexagonal architecture is to design our\nsoftware in a way that external dependencies, or implementation details\ndon't pollute the main purpose of the software we're building: the\nbusiness logic. Put in a different way: an information system is a\nsolution to a particular problem. We build software because we want\nsomething done. In that process, of course we'll have to deal with\naccidental complexity (the technical nuances of the technology involved\nin what we're building), after all, software doesn't run in the\nvacuum. But we don't build a software solution just to tinker with\ntechnology, we do it because we want something done. And those technical\nnuances do tend to change over time. This hinders the maintainability of\nour software, making it more fragile over time. That's why both aspects\nneed to be as isolated as possible.\nFor example, if we're building a service to present data to customers,\nwe can choose among several technologies like gRPC, HTTP (a REST API),\nGraphQL, and more. But none of those, whilst necessary for practical\nreasons, should matter to our business logic. Hence, interacting with\nexternal objects like [HttpServletRequest]{.title-ref}, or an ORM entity\nin the domain layer is a bad practice that accrues technical debt.\nInstead, ports and adapters ought to be used. Our domain layer will\ninteract with ports, and these ports will in turn, use adapters.\nThat way, changes in external dependencies don't affect the business\nlogic at all.\nWhat would be an example of a bad design? Imagine a web application. In\nthe domain layer, one of the objects needs to do some processing, so it\ntakes as one of its parameters the raw HTTP object provided by the web\nframework, then gets some parameters, then writes a SQL query, fetches\nthe data and returns a response.\nAnd how could we make that better? The same application, now in the\ndomain logic has an object that receives another object controlled by\nus (this is important, it should be one of our ports, not something\ncoming from an external library, framework, nor anything that entails\ntechnical details). This object has specific methods, tailored to the\nneeds of the application to retrieve only that abstractions and entities\nthat are needed, and then interacts with another port that will fetch\nthe required data from the repository, and return a specific entity as\nneeded. No HTTP details in the business logic, no SQL either.\nSome concepts\n\nDomain logic: also called business logic is where the main\nentities are located. This is where the purpose of the software is\nwritten, irrespective of any other technical details. The business\nrules live here isolated from any other external components.\nPorts: are ways for the domain logic layer to communicate with the\nexternal world. For example, in order to receive data from a\nprimary actor (a client that's using the application), this data\nwill pass through a port, because the integration isn't done\ndirectly. In the same fashion, in order to interact with a\nsecondary actor (like a repository, a place where data is stored),\nanother port will be used.\nAdapters: An adapter will connect the interface of a port with one\nspecific implementation of another interface. This usually follows\nthe idea behind the adapter design pattern.\n\nFor example if our web application needs to interact with a DynamoDB\ntable, our domain logic will have its own layer, with no implementation\ndetails revealed, and will interact with something called\n[StoragePort]{.title-ref} for example, which will have a simple\ninterface to fetch and update data. But this port won't have any of\nDynamoDB's implementation details either. In between, there will be an\nadapter, to precisely adapt the interface from the specific driver or\nclient needed for DynamoDB into the interface declared by\n[StoragePort]{.title-ref}.\nRelated Concepts\nThis design is based on other concepts from software engineering.\nAs the attentive reader might have suspected, the concept of adapter, is\nin fact closely related with the adapter design pattern. The idea of an\nadapter is to precisely match the interface of an external dependency (a\nconcrete and specific technology) with the interface defined by the\nport, according to the requirements of the domain logic.\nAnd speaking of declaring an interface to make external dependencies to\ncomply with: this is the [dependency inversion]{.title-ref} principle in\naction. The \"D\" of the SOLID principles.\nA small example\nHere's a simple class diagram with a class/interface defined for each\nof the main three components of the architecture.\n\nNote how we define a port (in this case the [DataRepository]{.title-ref}\nwith the interface we need for our application, and make the business\nlogic objects to interact solely with this one. If at some point we need\na PostgreSQL database, we create an adapter class that complies with the\n[DatabaseAdapter]{.title-ref} interface by implementing the required\nmethod. All details about configuring the driver, and writing the SQL\nqueries are abstracted in this adapter class. If later on we decide we\nneed a different database, another adapter can be created to this end.\nThis is not only useful for long-term maintainability of the project,\nbut also as a tactic to speed development up. Structuring the code this\nway, you could start your application with a very simple storage\nsolution (a text file, or SQLite). If later on, you really need a\npowerful database, then you can defer that decision, invest the cost\nof setting up that piece of infrastructure, and then easily plug it into\nthe code by just writing a different adapter object.\nWhere to learn more\nThe original blog post1 by Alistair Cockburn is a great source of\ninformation.\nIn addition, this is a concept I mention in the latest edition of my\nbook (Clean Code in Python), in\nthe chapter about clean architecture.\n1\nhttps://alistair.cockburn.us/hexagonal-architecture/\n\n","id":"https://rmariano.eu/hexagonal-architecture-introduction/","title":"Hexagonal Architecture - Introduction"},"https://rmariano.eu/libvirt-networking-libraries/":{"body":"Fedora 21 workstation seems to come with a lot of virtualization\nfeatures and most of the libvirt libraries installed.

La idea es sintetizar las principales ideas que me llevé y\nresaltar lo más importante.\nSe presentan a continuación un listado de las ideas principales por\ncharla con un breve listado de lo que más destaco por cada uno. Nótese\nque la lista no es de ninguna manera exhaustiva, y cada sección es en\nrealidad un breve párrafo ilustrativo a modo de resumen muy a alto\nnivel.\nCada sección lleva un título alusivo al tema de la presentación, un\nbreve resumen y una lista con los principales puntos que destaco.\nOrden en una arquitectura y la agilidad como atributo de calidad\nSe basó en la experiencia de un arquitecto liderando un equipo de\narquitectura para un desafiante proyecto. El disertante explicó los\nproblemas a resolver, y el marco tecnológico en el que se desarrolló la\nsolución, y cómo con una arquitectura elegante y simple con\nrelativamente pocos componentes se puede llevar a cabo una\nimplementación de gran porte que de soporte a 150.000 transacciones\nconcurrentes.\n\nEl factor clave del éxito de una arquitectura es la comunicación.\nLa agilidad de un equipo como atributo de calidad. Es interesante,\nporque cuando uno piensa en atributos de calidad se le ocurren cosas\ncomo seguridad, mantenibilidad, usabilidad, escalabilidad,\netc. pero no el hecho de ser ágil. Sin embargo es en general\ndeseable que el equipo sea ágil y se pueda adaptar fácilmente a los\ncambios, y en ese caso ¿Por qué no agregarlo como un atributo de\ncalidad?\nLa flexibilidad del equipo, también como atributo de calidad.\nAnálogo al anterior, pero con un detalle: si es un atributo de\ncalidad, tiene que ser medible. Lo interesante no es sólo la\noriginalidad de este tipo de atributos de calidad \"no\ntradicionales\", sino también en como considerarlos dentro de los\nescenarios de calidad.\nLos requerimientos deben priorizarse en el marco global de la\norganización.\n\nArquitectura y Big Data Analytics.\nUna presentación excelente, con mucho detalle y riqueza técnica,\nnombrando tecnologías, metodologías, técnicas, y estilos de arquitectura\norientados a Big Data.\n\nKafka como herramienta para procesamiento de información en colas de\nmensajes no tradicionales (con estado persistente). Es un ejemplo de\nuna tecnología que tuvo un caso de éxito real en proyectos de Big\nData.\nSiempre guardar la fuente de datos: llamada \"la fuente de la\nverdad\" (the source of truth), es una buena práctica, ya que\ntiene varias ventajas, como por ejemplo:\n\nPermite corregir errores en caso de falla (a partir de los\ndatos, se puede volver a procesar y no hay una pérdida\nirrecuperable de información).\nPreservando los datos originales (raw data), es posible en un\nfuturo elaborar o calcular nuevas métricas si se requieren, cosa\nque si por el contrario sólo se guardaran los datos procesados,\nsería imposible.\nEl costo extra por el almacenamiento no debería ser un problema,\nconsiderando los beneficios.\n\n\nProcesar la información de forma idempotente: esta quizá sea la\nidea que mejor refleja una buena práctica general, no solo aplicable\na Big Data. En lugar de procesar modificando registros (por ejemplo\nejecutando un SQL que sume uno en alguna columna), simplemente se\nagregue una nueva entrada y luego el resultado se calcule sobre el\ntotal. De esta manera no se modifican los datos, y de nuevo, un\npotencial error es reparable, no hay pérdida irreversible de\ninformación, etc. Ésta en realidad es una idea que ya existía en\nsistemas de BI, pero es interesante notar que registrar los hechos\nse puede usar para muchos más casos.\nSimplificar las variables tecnológicas. En lugar de tener un extenso\nrepertorio tecnológico con muchas tecnologías de propósito\nespecífico, es mejor y más fácil de mantener un entorno con menos\ntecnologías, y, aunque estas no se adapten perfectamente a cada\nproblema en particular, aún así hay que privilegiar el pragmatismo,\nhaciendo los ajustes necesarios.\nTener un esquema de datos (data schema) para poder integrar la\ninformación que se procesa desde diferentes fuentes.\n\nArquitecturas de Micro servicios.\nEs muy interesante escuchar sobre los micro servicios, y cómo este tipo\nde arquitecturas permiten una escalabilidad más flexible.\n\nLas arquitecturas de micro servicios permiten obtener la misma\nfuncionalidad, pero de forma distribuida, en contraposición a lo que\nsería una arquitectura monolítica.\nEsto permite escalar de forma más flexible, por ejemplo se pueden\nadministrar los subsistemas de forma independiente, asignando los\nrecursos o manteniendo más componentes pero más simples.\nEsta separación también puede reflejarse en equipos de trabajo,\náreas o procesos.\n\nArquitectura y métodos ágiles\nEn esta ocasión, se habló de la arquitectura de software desde el punto\nde vista de las metodologías ágiles y los procesos de desarrollo\nalineados a los requerimientos funcionales del negocio.\n\nEl equipo puede conversar la arquitectura en función de los\nrequerimientos con el PM, sin necesariamente entrar en muchos\ndetalles técnicos, concentrándose en la funcionalidad y\ncomportamiento esperado.\nÉsta conversación sobre la arquitectura debe ser constante a lo\nlargo de todo el ciclo de desarrollo.\n\nArquitectura aplicada la producción\nExcelente cierre de la conferencia. Hizo mucho hincapié en cómo se ve a\nla arquitectura y el rol del arquitecto o el equipo de arquitectura\ndesde el punto de vista del CIO. Ésto dilucidó bastante sobre lo que se\nespera del equipo de arquitectura para que la organización funcione.\nLo más destacado fue ver qué es lo que se espera y lo que NO se espera\ndel arquitecto, y cómo lo más importante es poder brindar una solución\ncomo ingenieros, que responda a las necesidades del negocio. La\nprincipal riqueza estuvo en que las ideas fueron ilustradas con\nexperiencias reales en Data Centers reales.\nAlgo llamativo es que muchas ideas mencionadas son en realidad\ncuestiones que se asumen en un proyecto de software, pero como sabemos\nen la práctica no siempre sucede, y esto deriva en malos resultados.\n\nLa integridad conceptual es fundamental: Las soluciones deben\nproporcionarse de forma uniforme, aplicando sendos estilos y\ntecnologías para los mismos tipos de problemas. Análogamente, si\npara diferentes proyectos se usan muchas tecnologías diferentes, el\nresultado es una arquitectura gigante y muy difícil de mantener.\nCada componente técnico interno del equipo de ingeniería no es el\nprincipal objetivo de la organización, si no que están para\nresponder a éstos.\nAdoptar nuevas tecnologías solo por que presenta algunas ventajas\nparciales no siempre es una buena idea a largo plazo. Suele suceder\nque a largo plazo termina teniendo consecuencias perjudiciales para\nel proyecto.\nLos sistemas deben diseñarse y construirse para durar varios años\n(~10), y esto implica que las tecnologías de construcción tienen\nque tener varios años de existir, de manera que sea razonable\naseverar que seguirán estando disponibles el tiempo que dure el\nsistema productivo. No sería deseable tener que mantener o hacerse\ncargo de tecnologías (frameworks, toolkits, etc.) obsoletas.\nCriticar las llamadas \"buenas prácticas\" (o verdades\nreveladas). Esto significa que cuando algo se denomina como buena\npráctica hay que plantearse si realmente es así, y aunque lo fuera,\nsi esas ventajas que trae aplican al proyecto en cuestión. Ésta es\notra idea más general, se trata en definitiva de tener pensamiento\ncrítico, pero es algo que en muchos casos no sucede, y vemos en\ngeneral varios proyectos aplicando \"patrones de diseño\" (o de\narquitectura) o \"buenas prácticas ágiles\", etc. sin pensar\nrealmente cómo aplican al proyecto (algo puede haber dado resultados\nexcelentes en otro proyecto, en otra empresa, en otro país, pero el\narquitecto debe considerar si esas variables realmente coinciden o\nson relevantes al contexto).\n\n&gt;&gt;&gt; Conclusiones\nConsidero que la conferencia fue muy buena, teniendo en cuenta la\ncalidad de las presentaciones, la experiencia de los disertantes y que\ntodo estaba alienado conceptualmente, lo cual hizo que la transición\nentre temas tuviera una continuidad notable.\nEs además importante destacar que este tipo de conferencias, además de\nser enriquecer la experiencia profesional de todos (disertantes,\norganizadores y concurrentes), benefician a la comunidad de arquitectos.\n","id":"https://rmariano.eu/notas-sobre-la-arqconf-2015/","title":"Notas sobre la ArqConf 2015"},"https://rmariano.eu/notes-on-fosdem19/":{"body":"FOSDEM19 it's just over, and here are my main highlights!\nSaturday\nAfter arriving to Brussels, and then to the venue, I wasn't on time for\nthe first talk that interested me, and then I couldn't make it into the\nHTTP/3 talk because the\nroom was full, so I decided to get an introduction to the conference by\nvisiting the stands, and networking.\nThe first talk I attended was VNF development made easy with\nnetmap,\nwhich was very good. Even though it's a topic different than what I\nusually work with, it was a really interesting talk with snippets of C\ncode and low-level operations in the slides, deep technical insights\ninto the details of networking, and quite enjoyable.\nIn the same development room followed a talk introducing\nONOS, a\nsoftware-defined networking platform (kind of like a \"kernel\" for\nnetworking in an architecture) written in Java, and with a large\ncommunity, sponsored by big companies.\nFrom the databases track, the talk Postgres goes to\n11! was a\nreally good introduction to the history of PostgreSQL, how the project\nstarted, its roots, what has been going on lately, how's the\ndevelopment process (the commit fests, and its tracking system are a\nwonderful idea, that I wish other projects adopt!); and why it's\nimportant to always update the engine (even minor releases contain\nimportant changes and bug-fixes!). It also briefly covered the last new\nfeatures that have been added to the database, and what can be expected\nfor the next release, 12.\nAbout to start!#PostgreSQL #FOSDEM2019 pic.twitter.com/MrbMhWrEsb— Mariano (@rmarianoa) February 2, 2019 \nAfter that it was time for a talk about how Netflix uses\nFreeBSD for\nits streaming platform. It started with a great introduction to their\nplatform and architecture (impressive as you might expect, for instance\ntheir CDN handles 100Tb/s!), and what are the main drivers for their\ntechnical decisions (e.g. speed vs. costs, optimization of the\nworkloads, etc.). After that introduction, it was time to move to the\ncore of the presentation, and explain their software engineering\napproach. The main takeaway was their aggressive strategy to incorporate\nchanges from FreeBSD as fast as possible, by keeping track of the\n\"head\" of the repository rather than one of the stable branches.\nThrough development cycles of ~5 weeks, it's possible to integrate\nwith the new features faster, pay the price of merging early, and\nachieve a faster velocity of delivery.\nThe next talk was PostgreSQL vs.\nfsync an\namazing talk. It provided a deeply technical insight on the internals\nof the database, and how it does to implement the I/O stack by relying\non the [fsync]{.title-ref} syscal, and why everybody assumed it worked\nin a way when in reality it was doing something different\n(here there are more information for\nthe curious).\nThe last talk of the day, was Walking through walls PostgreSQL ♥\nFreeBSD.\nAnother superb talk. One of the ones I enjoyed the most, actually.\nAgain, super technical, in this case it all started by an analysis of\nhow does PostgreSQL perform on BSD systems (spoiler alert: no so well by\naround ~2014). After that, there were several changes being made, both\nin FreeBDS and in PostgreSQL in order to make it faster. It was a good\ntechnical review of operating systems internals (for instance, the\ncomponent of PostgreSQL that sets the process name as the query that's\ncurrently running, was slow because in BSD, it relied on a function of\nthe standard library that used two system calls, therefore a new\nfunction -- setproctitle_fast(3)-- was created to accomplish the\nsame without system calls at all, achieving a 10% of performance gain).\nThere were multiple other examples like this one that made the\npresentation very enlightening. Actually it was closely related to the\nprevious one in the sense that the \"fsyncgate\" was mentioned, and\nthe dilemma of relying on the operating systems capabilities vs.\nimplementing direct I/O reappeared.\nThat was the first day, packed with technical talks, and a lot of\nknowledge. But it wasn't quite over yet: there was still a nice dinner\norganized by the Python development room ahead.\nSunday\nThe morning was focused on the Python development room. The first talk I\nwas able to attend was about\nGraphQL,\nwhich is a relatively new technology for web APIs development, that I\nhave worked in the past with.\nThen it followed a talk about how to write pylint\nplugins.\nIt makes me happy to see there are people who realise that the quality,\nand standards, in the code are something that has to be enforced by\ntools, and not left out for people to the code review phase.\nThe next talk was about a library for managing configuration in\nservices,\nwhich was quite interesting\nAfter that one I presented my talk about coroutines and asynchronous\nprogramming:\nFull house for @rmarianoa telling us about coroutines @PythonFOSDEM #Python #FOSDEM pic.twitter.com/bIq1bNQNjI— Eric Gazoni (@ericgazoni) February 3, 2019 \nThen, more talks, more networking, and the last talk was Breaking\nPostgreSQL at\nscale.\nAnother solid talk (this track is actually one of the best). It explored\nseveral parameters, constraints, and considerations to take into account\nwhen dealing with databases of different scales, starting with small\nones (&lt;=10Gb), medium ones (~100Gb - 1TB), or large ones (&gt;1TB).\nIt's interesting to see how at the beginning you can get away with\npretty much anything, but as the data grows, more fine tuning has to be\ndone, and different strategies (e.g. sharding, or changing the backup\npolicy), come into play.\nAnd that was the end of the conference for me.\nFinal Remarks\nThere were lots of talks that I wished to, but couldn't attend, for a\nvariety of reasons (transportation, logistics, some rooms were full and\ndidn't allow more people to get in, overlaps in the schedule, etc.) I\nwill try to watch the videos for these talks as they're being released,\nalong with following up with the slides.\nBesides this perfectly understandable mishap, I really enjoyed the\nconference, and learned a lot, about many different things (cloud\ncomputing, databases, infrastructure, programming languages, and\noperating systems).\nIt was great to attend a conference packed with highly technical talks\n(it's really lovely to spend a day leaning through solid presentations\nwith slides full of code snippets, and configuration files), and I think\nthat's a great differential compared to many other previous conferences\nI attended in the past (probably the exception being the Kafka summit\nin London last\nyear): the content\nis highly technical, and focused on technology.\nFOSDEM is great for expanding the technical portfolio because the\nconference offers multiple tracks in parallel and with different\ntechnologies.\n","id":"https://rmariano.eu/notes-on-fosdem19/","title":"Notes on FOSDEM19"},"https://rmariano.eu/notes-on-pyss18/":{"body":"Last weekend an amazing edition of Python San Sebastián took place.

It's a very interesting topic,\nand presented with the main tools to work in Python: Jupyter, numpy,\npandas, etc. Promising start.\nSaturday was the first day for talks, and it started with a nice keynote\nabout the Python community, followed by a nice presentation about web\nscraping with Python tools, that also covered some tricks to do with\nPostgreSQL, such as efficiently computing the distance between strings\nwith a special operator available through an extension.\nAfter that, I presented my talk titled Demystifying coroutines and\nasynchronous programming in Python, on which I covered the basics\nbehind modern asynchronous programming.\nIt followed a presentation with an introduction about Django REST\nframework, with a good explanation of not just the technical stack but\nalso web concepts, and the ideas behind REST. After the presentation it\nwas time for lunch.\nAfter lunch we enjoyed a talk about the challenges from the Plone\ncommunity on evolving their Python code base. I always learn and get\ninspired when I listen to a Plone talk. It followed a keynote on deep\nlearning, and after that it was time for lightning talks.\nFrom all the good lightning talks, there was one that kind of reminded\nme of the \"WATs\" of Pythons, showing code snippets that were seemingly\nwrong (or plain wrong in some cases(, but valid with small tweaks).\nSee what I mean:\n\nSunday started with another great keynote about processing music with\nPython. After the coffee break, there was a talk by Stephane Wirtel\ntelling us what's new in Python 3.7, followed by a talk about the hug\nframework and how to build REST APIs with it, and then the last talk of\nthe morning was about optimization algorithms (in the sort of dynamic\nprogramming, etc.), to solve real-world problems for a real platform.\nIt's one of my favourite topics, so I enjoyed that talk a lot.\nAfter lunch, the last talks were about building a bot for Telegram, and\na keynote about machine learning, and the tools that Python provides for\nit (scikit learn, and similar to those covered at the workshop the first\nday).\nThen the lightning talks, and the closure of the conference, which was\namazing and I enjoyed very much.\nAll in all: a great conference on which I've met awesome professionals,\nI learnt new things and got a refresher on topics I was already familiar\nwith, and got inspired to keep learning.

To get a good\nexperience, I attended talks of the three types, but with a little\npreference towards internals and streams.\nIt was a two-day conference with lots of valuable technical content,\nawesome talks, speakers, and a lot more. Here are the highlights.\nDay 1\nThe Keynotes\nThe first keynote, \"The Death and Rebirth of the Event Driven\nArchitecture\", was the perfect way to start the conference. Totally a\nmind-opening talk, to get the right idea of what is the state of the art\nin terms of distributed systems, and event-driven architectures in\nmodern software engineering.\nSome of the main ideas, phrases, and concepts of this talk:\n\nNot just the architectures, but also the business are\nevent-oriented. You can think a business, every business, as a large\nset of events occurring at all times. The architecture then, is just\nreflecting this.\nEvery business is now digital. Start-ups create their architecture,\nand build their business upon it. Legacy companies, adapt to this,\nso their software architecture becomes the core of the business, and\nthey operate based on this.\n\nThe rest of the talks were amazing as well, and in the majority I chose\ntalks of the tracks of stream processing and pipelines with some\nexceptions on which I attended a talk about internals that explained key\nmetrics to monitor in a Kafka installation, how Kafka uses the JVM heap\ninternals, and why this (along with a lot of more metrics, such as the\nKernel I/O pagination cache) are key metrics to monitor.\nAt the end of the day, I had the chance to talk to some of the speakers\nand keep up enlightening discussions about event sourcing architectures.\nDay 2\nShorter than the previous one (finished at around 1pm), but the talk\nwere equally amazing.\nIt was impressive to see how some big companies use Kafka directly on\nDocker containers, with Kubernetes, and a monitoring platform\nautomatically sending metrics to Grafana. There was a talk explaining\nthe immense infrastructure at CERN, and how Kafka plays a crucial role\non their data processing solutions.\nAll in all it was a great conference, on which I learnt a lot about\nKafka, distributed systems, event sourcing architecture.

How\ncan this fail?, and such. It's important, because this is critical in\norder to make robust software. Most problems I have seen on software\nbugs were related to some optimistic thinking, and even worse,\noptimistic unit testing, in the way that developers only test for\nhappy-path scenarios, without thinking all sort of things that can go\nwrong.\nAfterwards, was the time for the talk about parallel processing (poor\nperson's parallel processing), which was fine. Then I spent some time\ntackling some of the challenges sponsors had available, so I did some\ncoding and recap of the events so far.\nThen I listened to a talk about\nwolfcrypt\nwhich is a tool for crypto in Python.

The main conclusion that I took from the\npresentation was that, even in the early days there were some really\ntough challenges to overcome (for example the use of indentation,\nscripting, etc.), and Python surmounted it. These challenges were,\nperhaps even bigger than today's ones (debates about Python 2/3, etc.),\nwhich makes me think that current issues don't jeopardize the future of\nPython at all, so the community and the language will get through them.\nReally inspiring, and engaging.\nThen it was the time for my new talk\ndiscovering-descriptors{.interpreted-text role=\"doc\"}. I got some\ninteresting questions from the audience, and on general I had a good\ntime presenting, so that was another good experience. After the\npresentation, while doing some networking, I got good feedback about it,\nand was asked about the source for it, which I made public.\nThen I attended some issues, took a look at the challenges, and after\nlunch, I listened to Armin Ronacher's talk, titled A Python and Rust\nlove story, which was another wonderful talk. I really enjoy these kind\nof polyglot talks, because that's the true spirit of software\narchitecture (what this blog is about): to find the best tool (language)\nfor the problem at hand, which might not always be Python. So it's\ninteresting to see how other languages can complement our solution, in\ninteresting ways. I learnt more about the building and packaging system\nof Rust, and the code snippets were a good way to get a first impression\nof the language. Definitely something to investigate further.\nOn the challenges I did reasonably well, and I got the book OpenShift\nfor developers from the stand of Red Hat, which was nice. I'll read it\non the flight back.\nThen there was another good talk called building an algorithmic trading\nplatform in Python 3, which left me with some libraries to investigate,\nnamely aiokafka, and\nfastavro.

I was already experienced with the library, since I've\nused, Elasticsearch with Python, but even though, this workshop gave\nme a deeper understanding of the concepts behind it (there was a lot\nabout the internals of Elasticsearch, how it works, its configuration,\nconcepts of information retrieval, etc.), so I got new ideas. On the\npractical side, I'll check this\nproject.\nThe second one started with an overview of Kubernetes and OpenShift,\nand shortly thereafter, we started with the practical assignment, on\nwhich we deployed an application on\nthe OpenShift cloud.\nThe tools required for this are quite interesting. Personally, I prefer\nthe command line tool (oc client) to the web interface, not only\nbecause it seems more familiar (for one using Linux), but also because\nit provides more features and a richer interface. For example (at this\npoint), cron jobs cannot be created through the web interface, but only\nfrom the command line with this client (and it was part of the\nexercise).

In this regard, it was interesting to see how they have lots\nof legacy applications written in J2EE, with Java frameworks, that are\noutdated, difficult to maintain, and they mentioned the idea of\nmigrating them to new, more modern technologies. In this sense, there\nare already projects in progress, and they chose Python + Django for the\nmigration and re-implementation of the legacy systems.\nThis was a very interesting in the sense that more than this was\nactually presented. In particular the idea of how the government wants\nto actually own their systems, and therefore they are now choosing open\nsource software. It goes beyond than merely using Python and Django:\nthey are also migrating the workstation machines to open source software\n(Ubuntu), and trying to earn more contractors that are startups rather\nthan huge multinationals with proprietary software. The idea is still\nthe same: they want open data, transparency, and to actually own their\nsystems.\nThese sort of initiatives are gaining more and more traction in the\nEuropean Union, as many cities are starting to shift towards an open\ngovernment, with open data, and more transparency. I look forward to\nseeing more projects in Python with open source technologies, at their\nGitHub account2, in the forthcoming months.\nThe second talk was about\nConda, and shortly\nthereafter a brief introduction, the rest of the presentation was mostly\na demo (live coding! :-), on which we saw several examples of installing\npackages, exporting the environment, creating a new one from a template,\netc. It was useful to see both the strengths and shortcomings of the\ntool, what can and cannot be done with it, and how it can be useful for\ndevelopers that have to deal with several system dependencies.\nThe third and last talk, was about PLONE, a\nCMS project\nwritten in Python, and with its 15-year-old tenure, is the oldest Python\nproject (thing that I did not know). It was interesting to learn about\nits high-level architecture, components, and the way they work. Above\nthat, I would like to highlight the recap that it was done about many\nunderappreciated zope libraries, that have been\navailable in Python for a long time, doing an amazing job. It is now in\nmy list, to review them.\nAll in all, it was a good meetup, and I liked very much the technical\nlevel of the talks, and the fact that the topics were very diverse, yet\ninteresting. I would like to continue attending these meetups, and in\nthe future I might even submit a talk.\n1\nhttps://www.meetup.com/es-ES/python-185/events/235058828/\n\n2\nhttps://github.com/AjuntamentdeBarcelona\n\n","id":"https://rmariano.eu/python-barcelona-november-meetup-notes/","title":"Python Barcelona November meetup notes"},"https://rmariano.eu/python-functions-return-values-consistency/":{"body":"This post is inspired on an issue I once found, while I was using a\nwell-known library in Python for parsing YAML files. The problem was\nthat when it was loading the content of the file, the result was not\ncoherent, because sometimes it returned the content as a python\ndict, but if the file was empty, the return value was None.\nDo you notice something odd here?\nWhat if I want to use the result? I cannot do it safely, for example:\n\nIf content is None, it will raise an AttributeError saying that None\nhas no attribute called \"items\" (which is true).\nTherefore, the developer should catch the exception or avoid the corner\ncase, by doing something like the following:\n\nThat could be a case of \"coding defensively\", making sure that the\nprogram will not fail under most conditions (it would also require to\nadd an assert or to raise an exception perhaps, but that is a\ndifferent topic). I actually agree with defensive programming, but I\nthink it is better if the library itself has a more correct behaviour,\nrespecting the interface (that is: if you are going to return a\ndictionary, and there is not content, then the logical assumption is to\nexpect an empty dictionary). This must be the default behaviour, not\nsomething to be set by parameters.\nThis could be thought as an instance of a more general problem that\noccurs when some function is intended to return \"X or Y\". In my\nopinion, if X and Y do not share the same interface, there is a\npotential bug (in the Object-Oriented paradigm we would say that there\nis no polymorphism, or maybe that the \"contract\" is not being\nrespected).\nThis is an example that I wanted to highlight, because it might help you\nto write cleaner code.\n","id":"https://rmariano.eu/python-functions-return-values-consistency/","title":"On returning consistent data types"},"https://rmariano.eu/refuse-the-temptation-to-pass/":{"body":"This is an opinion I sometimes remember when seeing some code. Don't\ntake it as a strong advice, or a rule, but instead as a general\nguideline that might help you to improve the code slightly.\nOn this post I will share a tiny and opinionated argument about why\nthere are usually better things to do in the code instead of just\npass.\nDisclaimer: I am not saying that pass should be banned from the\nlanguage, or that is an anti-pattern, or a bad idiom. Nothing like that.\nIf that were the case, it wouldn't be a keyword (and we know how few\nkeywords Python has, and how hard it is to introduce a new one, so it's\nthere for a good reason).\nHowever, what I do argue, is that some of the nice features of Python\nare often over-used, and the temptation to abuse a nice feature shadows\nbetter opportunities.\nFor example, when defining exceptions:\n\nIt's better to place a docstring explaining its raison d'etre, which\neliminates the necessity for the pass and the empty body:\n\nThis also complies with the general good practice of \"use docstrings\nin every function, class, and module defined\". In my opinion, it's a\nmuch better choice.\nThe same criteria applies for empty base classes.\nHow about when dealing with exceptions?\nSometimes, the occurrence of an exception is a controlled scenario, and\nagain pass looks really tempting:\n\nHere the worst part is not even the pass, but the comment! Yes,\ncomments represent our failure to express our ideas into code, and they\nare therefore, bad. We can cheat a little bit here, but (on the bright\nside), do something more useful: How about logging the message?\n\nIf all of this seems unnecessary, we can\nsuppress\nthe exception:\n\nThere are lots of cases like this when using the keyword pass seems\nlike a viable option.

After the talk,\nan attendee told me that he liked it, and asked me about the code\nportrayed in one of the slides, the one about decorators with the\nexample of moving some records from one table to another. He asked me if\nI ran code like that one in production, to which I answered no: the code\nis entirely fictional, and it was done for the mere purposes of the\nexamples, so I just needed an excuse for a task that could be done in\ntwo SQL statements, so the example with the decorator can be shown.\nThe code of the example follows:\n\nThen I learnt that there is another way of writing that sort of\nstatements, with the \"returning\" sentence of PostgreSQL.\nIt would be re-written like:\n\nOr... the other way around:\n\nThe interesting point here, is that it entails a single command, instead\nof two.

Hopefully nowadays, modern operating systems like Linux\nhave great tools and features that we could take advantage of.\nIn particular, I would like to setup a simple database locally using\ndocker, and storing the data in\nmemory.\nThe idea is simple: run a docker container with the image for\nPostgresSQL, using a tmpfs12 as storage for the database (a\nramfs could also be used).\nProcedure\nFirst, we get the image of PostgresSQL according to the platform, for\nexample:\n\nThen, I could create a tmpfs, for the data and mount it\n\nNow we could run the database container using this directory:\n\nThe first line indicates the name for the container we are running (if\nis not specified, docker will put a default one); the second line is the\nimportant one, since it is what makes the mapping of directories,\nmeaning that will map the directory for the tmpfs on the host, mounted\nas /var/lib/pgsql/data inside the container (the target). The later\ndirectory is the one PostgreSQL uses by default for initializing and\nstoring the data of the database. The Z at the end of the mapping is\nan internal detail for flagging that directory in case SELinux is\nenabled, so it will not fail due to a permissions errors (because\ncontainers run as another user, and we are mounting something that might\nbe out of that scope)3.\nThe rest of the three lines, are environment variables that docker will\nuse for the initialization of the database (they are optional, and\ndefaults will be used, in case they are not provided). Then follows the\nport mapping, which in this case indicates to map the port 5432 inside\nthe container to the same one on the host. And finally, the name of the\ndocker image we will run.\nOnce this is running, it would look like we have an actual instance of\nPostgreSQL up and running on our machine (actually we do, but it is\ninside a container :-), so we can connect with any client (even a\nPython application, etc.).\nFor example, if we want to use the psql client with the container, the\ncommand would be:\n\nApplications\nIf we have PostgreSQL installed, we could simply start a new instance\nas our user with the command (postgres ...) and pass the -D\nparameter with the desired path where the database is going to store the\ndata (which will be the tmpfs/ramdisk). This would be another way of\nachieving the same.\nRegardless the implementations, here are some potential applications:\n\nLocal development without requiring disk storage, and running faster\nat the same time.\nUnit testing: unit tests should be fast, granted. Sometimes, it\nmakes perfect sense to run the tests against an actual database\n(practicality beats purity), even if this makes them\n\"integration/functional\" tests. In this regard, having a\nlightweight database container running locally could achieve the\ngoal without compromising performance.\nIsolation: (this only applies for the container approach), running\nPostgreSQL in a docker container, encapsulates the libraries,\ntools, packages, etc. in docker, so the rest of the system does\nnot have to maintain much other packages installed. Think of if as a\nsort of \"virtual environment\" for packages.\n\nAll in all, I think it's an interesting approach, worth considering, at\nleast to have alternatives when working in projects that require intense\ninteraction with the database.\n1\n: https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/filesystems/tmpfs.txt\n\n2\n: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tmpfs\n\n3\n:\nhttp://www.projectatomic.io/blog/2015/06/using-volumes-with-docker-can-cause-problems-with-selinux/\n\n","id":"https://rmariano.eu/running-postgresql-in-memory-with-docker/","title":"Running PostgreSQL in memory with docker"},"https://rmariano.eu/running-rabbitmq-server-on-docker/":{"body":"If you use RabbitMQ for development frequently, sometimes you might have\nfound it uses too much resources (it's normal while programming to have\na lot of queues or tasks being queued and that makes the CPU usage to\nspike).\nHaving RabbitMQ installed on the OS seems the perfect approach for\nproduction, but on development I'd rather do something different, in\norder to isolate the process. I know I could bound it (for example order\nit not to start automatically as a dæmon), by means of systemd but a\nfew weeks ago I decided to try docker and see how it results.\nIt turned out to be just the tool for the work, and so far with a little\nsimple configuration it can run as expected.\nThere is already a docker image for RabbitMQ, which can be automatically\npulled, and then run, for example:\n\nThe -d option indicates the process to start detached, then by\npassing -e we pass some environment variables (in this case, the\nRABBITMQ_NODENAME is a particular variable for rabbit indicating how\nto set the name of the node it is starting). Optionally, we can limit\nthe CPU usage with the --cpuset, as in this case which sets the\nprocess to use the second core of the machine (it starts at\n[0]{.title-ref}). Then the --name is a name for the docker being\ncreated.\nThe most important part in this case is the port mapping, made by the\n-p option which in this case maps the port used by RabbitMQ directly\n(1:1) with the host machine. This makes the docker process to run\ntransparently, as the other applications that try to communicate with a\nRabbitMQ won't notice any difference, making it look like is executing\nan actual RabbitMQ service. Finally there is the name of the docker\nimage to run.\nWhat I usually do is to manage the docker image by its\n[instance_id]{.title-ref} (a number that is displayed after listing the\ndocker images, by doing sudo docker ps -a). Then we can manage it by\nsudo docker [start|stop] &lt;instance_id&gt;.\nThere is another command to see the output being generated by the\nprocess which is docker logs rabbitmq.docker. Notice in this case the\nname designated to the image was used instead of the instance_id. In\naddition we can see internal data for the process by running the\ninspect command (again we can use the [instance_id]{.title-ref} or the\nname we assigned).\n\nIt's important to notice that docker is actually not a virtualization\nplatform, but a mechanism that runs processes in containers, meaning\nthat in this case the entire RabbitMQ is running as a single process\nwithin a container, with some other limitations and bounds constrained\nby docker.\nI found this approach to be very versatile for a development\nenvironment, and with RabbitMQ being the first pilot, I think I can\nmigrate more applications to docker instead of having them installed on\nthe system (as long as possible).\n","id":"https://rmariano.eu/running-rabbitmq-server-on-docker/","title":"Running RabbitMQ server on Docker"},"https://rmariano.eu/second-edition-is-here/":{"body":"Clean code in Python, second\nedition\nhas been published, and here are the main highlights!\n\nWhat's new from the previous edition?\nThe main change is that the book has been updated to Python 3.9.

Since then, a lot has\nchanged in Python and the book addresses the new features.\nIn particular, there's been a lot of improvements in the area of\nasynchronous programming. More to the point, asynchronous programming is\nbecoming even more common on all projects, so the entire chapter 7\n(originally dedicated to generators and iteration) has been revisited\nwith a strong focus on asynchronous programming, showing how to also\nwrite more succinct code in this model.\nAll chapters have been revisited, and the examples updated to take\nadvantage of the latest developments in Python.

This new\nedition shows how to take advantage of those features in order to write\nmore compact code that's easier to read and maintain.\nThe tools and libraries have been upgraded as well, and more tools are\nintroduced. For instance, important concepts like dependency injection\nare now supported with a library that makes things easier in Python.\nWhat to expect from the book\nYou can expect a new version that follows the same pattern of presenting\nan introduction to the concepts being learnt, followed by examples that\nillustrate the idea. As always, I try to keep the examples concise as to\navoid distractions, and focus on the topic at hand, whilst at the same\ntime, make them relevant examples. This means, the code in the book\nrepresents situations that might very well happen in a real project, as\nopposed to made-up things like Fibonacci sequences.\nThe challenge here is try to make it relevant for different audiences:\nsoftware developers, systems administrators, and data scientists. Even\nthough the book focuses on software construction, the concepts (and\ntheir corresponding examples), are also relevant for data processing for\nexample.\nIt's still a book with a pragmatic approach. I discuss the theory,\nbut at the end of the day, the goal is that you're presented with\nsomething you can effectively implement in your day-to-day tasks.

Any good\nsoftware engineer understands that details matter a lot, as they make\nthe difference between a working unit or a disaster1.\nThis is why clean code is not just about formatting or arranging the\ncode. It's neither a foible. It is instead, paying attention exactly to\nthose details that will make a big difference in production.\nLet's see some examples of this in Python.\nDisclaimer: The following cases being presented are just examples. They\nare not meant to be interpreted as patterns, in the sense of \"every\ntime you find X, apply Y\".\nBelow there are two short cases of problematic code I have found in\nwhilst working on past code bases.\nMutable Objects and Attributes\nThis is one of the main reasons why I like functional programming:\nimmutability.\nIn functional software, we wouldn't be talking about mutation, because\nsuch a thing is simply not allowed. But I digress. The point is that in\nmost of the software defined with objects, they mutate, they change\ntheir internal state or representation. It's true that we could have\nimmutable objects, but that's usually not the case.\nConsider the following code (spoiler: there is something really wrong\nwith it).\n\nWhen trying to use dictionaries to pass keyword arguments, it might be\ntempting to mutate them in order to adapt it to the signature of the\nfunction we want to call. But before mutating an object, we should think\non it's scope and the consequences this mutation will bring.\nIn this case, the dictionary that the method mutates belongs to the\nclass. Changing it, will change the class. After it has been mutated,\nthe default values will remain from the last time it was updated.\nMoreover, since this dictionary belongs to the class, all instances\n(including new ones), will carry on with this:\n\nAs we can observe, this is not what we want, and it's extremely\nfragile.\nHere are some general recommendations:\n\nDon't change mutable objects passed by parameter to functions.\nCreate new copies of the objects whenever possible, and return them\naccordingly.\nDon't mutate class attributes.\nTry not to set mutable objects as class attributes.\n\nNeedless to say, there are exceptions to these rules, after all\npragmatism beats purity. Here are some obvious exceptions to these\nrules2: :\n\nFor item 1, we always have to consider the trade-off memory/speed.\nIf the object it's too big (perhaps a large dictionary), running\ncopy.deepcopy() on it will be slow, and it will take a lot of\nmemory, so it's probably faster to just modify it in place.\nThe obvious exception for rule [2] is when using descriptors, but\nbecause it's likely an scenario on which we are counting on that\nside effect. Other than that, there shouldn't be any reason to go\non such a dangerous path.\nRule [3] shouldn't be a problem if the attributes are read-only,\nand we're sure they are never going to be mutated. In that case,\nsetting dictionaries and lists as class attributes, might be fine,\nbut I'm only worried about the fact that even though you can be\nsure that right now there is no method mutating them, you can't\nassure nobody will break that rule in the future.\n\nIterators\nThe iterator protocol in Python is a great feature. It allows us to\ntreat an entire set of objects by their behaviour regardless of their\ninternal representation.\nFor instance we can write a code like:\n\nAnd we don't know exactly what myiterable is. It might be a list, a\ntuple, a dictionary, a string, and it will still work.\nWe can also rely on all methods that use this protocol,\n\nOf course mylist has to be a list, but again myiterable can be\nanything that can be iterated over.\nUnfortunately, this amazing feature it's also the cause of some subtle\nheadaches.\nA long time ago, I remember hearing a complaint from a co-worker saying\nthat a part of the code was particularly slow. The code in question was\na function that was supposed to process and then move files to a given\ntarget directory. You can imagine something like this:\n\nNow what happens? Like in the introduction, we are using the iterator\nprotocol, so we rely on the fact that we don't exactly know what\nfiles_to_process is exactly (a tuple, a list, etc.)\nThere is a subtle issue. Strings are also iterable. If you pass a\nsingle file, let's say /home/ubuntu/foo, each character will be\niterated over, starting with / (the root directory), following with\nh, etc. That's why the programs was slow. It was copying the entire\nfile system!\nThe solution is to use a better interface, that disallow these errors\nentirely:\n\nIn this example the signature of the function exposes a much nicer\ninterface, in the sense that it can allow one or multiple files as\narguments, without the issue of the previous example. This change also\nmakes target_directory to be keyword-only, which is more explicit as\nwell.\nClosing words\nI hope you enjoyed the content, and that you got an idea of how critical\nsome details can be.\nThe real value of clean code is to avoid disasters. Topics like these\nones (and more), are covered in my latest\ntitle,\nshould the reader be interested.\n1\nI'm not exaggerating when I say disaster. There are many famous\nexamples of crashes in software as a result of edge cases, or errors\nthat can be narrowed down to a single line of code.\n\n2\nThe list is by no means exhaustive.\n\n","id":"https://rmariano.eu/subtleties-of-python/","title":"Subtleties of Python"},"https://rmariano.eu/tags/":{"body":"","id":"https://rmariano.eu/tags/","title":"Tags"},"https://rmariano.eu/the-set-name-method-for-descriptors/":{"body":"Descriptors generally have to interact with attributes of the managed\nobject, and this is done by inspecting __dict__ on that object (or\ncalling getattr/setattr, but the problem is the same), and finding the\nkey under the specific name.\nFor this reason, the descriptor will have to know the name of the key to\nlook for, which is related to the name of the attribute is managing.\nOn previous versions of Python this had to be done explicitly.

For example in:\n\nWhat we require is to check that the name is passed to the descriptor\nproperly, basically:\n\nBut we don't want to pass the string 'descriptor' as a parameter when\nconstructing it, because it's repetitive. Instead, we want this to be\nconfigured automatically. Let's see some options.\nA class decorator\nWith a class decorator, we could define all decorators for the class as\nparameters of the decorator, and make the assignment of the name in it\nas well.\nSomething like this:\n\nThe condition is preserved:\n\nIn this decorator, we provide the name and the class of the descriptor\nto be created, and the decorator instantiates the class with this name.\nWe could also have created the instance directly in the descriptor, and\nthen update the value with setattr(descriptor, 'name', dname), which\nis more general, in case you want to create descriptors that take\nmultiple arguments on their __init__ method, but for this case it's\njust fine.\nThen we set the new descriptor (the one that has the name already\nupdated on it), to the wrapped class.\nHowever, it still seems a bit unfamiliar or counter-intuitive that\nwe're defining the descriptor not in the body of the class, but as a\nparameter of a decorator.\nThere must be another way.\nA meta-class\nImagine we flag the class by adding a __set_name = True attribute on\nit, in order to hint the meta-class that this is going to be one of the\nattributes that need its name changed. Then the meta-class would look\nsomething like:\n\nAnd again:\n\nOne detail is that the __init__ of the descriptor accepts the name to\nbe nullable so this works. Another option would have been defining only\nthe descriptor assigned to the class, and then, re-mapping the attribute\nwith the instance, passing the name when it's being constructed on the\nmeta-class. Both options are the same, and the example was made with\nsimplicity in mind.\nThis works but it has a couple of issues. First we have to somehow\nidentify when the class attribute needs to be updated (in this case, a\nflag was added to it, but other alternatives are no better at all). The\nsecond problem should be rather obvious: it's not a good use of\nmeta-classes, and this is overkill (to say the least) for what should be\na simple task.\nThere must be a better way.\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^ And there is. At least for Python 3.6 and\nhigher. The __set_name__ method was included, which is automatically\ncalled when the class is being created, and it receives two parameters:\nthe class and the name of the attribute as it appears defined in the\nclass.\nWith this, the problem is reduced to just simply:\n\nAnd that's it, no other code is needed. The solution is much simpler,\nand it entails less problems.\nActually, I deliberately named the flag __set_name, to get an idea of\nwhat's coming, and to hint that with __set_name__, Python must be\ndoing something similar to the example, but in this case we shouldn't\nworry about it.\nConclusion\nEven though it's fine to just know about the last method, and we could\nsimply use that, it's still important to have followed this path,\nthinking about how things were done previously, because it's not fair\nto just assume things were always good, and take that for granted.\nOtherwise, we would miss the evolution of the language, and assume there\nwere never issues, problems or things that needed revision.\nAnd more importantly, there still are. Python still has lots of other\nareas for improvement. Just as in this example __set_name__ seems to\nsolve a small, yet annoying problem, there are many other scenarios on\nwhich things are not crystal clear in Python, so the language still\nneeds to evolve.\n","id":"https://rmariano.eu/the-set-name-method-for-descriptors/","title":"The __set_name__ method for descriptors"},"https://rmariano.eu/topics-ive-changed-my-mind-about/":{"body":"Ten years ago, I had very different opinions with respect to some software engineering topics, and in fact,\nI have even blogged about it. But recently, I've come to realize I think differently, so let's see.\nChanging your mind about something is not bad, since it can mean a number of different things: for example, that\nyou have more data that you didn't have before, that you have more experience, or simply that the facts have changed.\nFor example, I used to think that:\n\nJava was a bad language: because I was comparing its verbosity to how succinctly software can be written in other languages.\nBut the truth is that despite lacking all these shiny bells and whistles, Java is a very solid and reliable technology for\nenterprise-grade software, and is extremely battle-tested. It is a good choice, precisely because it's a \"boring technology\".\nAt the end of the day, our job as professionals is to deliver working software solutions, so perhaps we should focus more on that,\nand not so much about having fun and playing with the latest shiny new thing, following the hype.\nPython was a good language: specially because I was naïve enough to believe that Python followed its zen code, but it turns out\nthe language provides many obscure and non-obvious ways of doing the same thing (this probably deserves a separate post).\nDynamic typing was a good thing: it's good to hit the ground running, but in the long run it just doesn't properly scale, specially\nwhen you have a large distributed team working on the same project. This is also another topic for a post of its own, but at a very high level\nI'll say that dynamic typing makes you have to test for things you wouldn't have if you have a proper static typing system with a good compiler. And large\nPython projects, for instance, would only scale by using type annotations, which is like a poor proxy for what languages like Go have to offer.\nVim was a one-size-fits-all sword: I will (although rarely) use vim for some tasks that are otherwise nearly impossible, but compared to other\neditors, it doesn't make much more sense, considering how much productive I can be on Visual Studio Code. I love vim, and it gives me real power when I truly need it,\nbut for that other 95% of the time, I've switched to simpler tools.\nRebase was wrong: and I was very strong on this one, but now I do git rebase -i every day, and life is great, so there's that.\n\nI still think that:\n\nOOP was a terrible idea: It did way more harm than good, and it's just an incomplete paradigm that can't be properly fulfilled in any\nmeaningful project, if we want to be pragmatic engineers.\ngit is awesome (and battle-tested): and now even more so than 10 years ago!\nSCRUM is nonsense: and this doesn't need any further explanation. Time has given me the reason.\n\n","id":"https://rmariano.eu/topics-ive-changed-my-mind-about/","title":"Topics I've changed my mind about"},"https://rmariano.eu/types-of-descriptors/":{"body":"Resuming from where we left off, on the previous post, on which we took\na-first-look-at-descriptors{.interpreted-text role=\"doc\"}, it's time\nto explore their different types and how they work internally.\nIn Python, almost everything is represented with a dictionary. Objects\nare dictionaries. Classes are objects, hence they also are contained\ninto a dictionary. This is denoted by the __dict__ attribute that\nobjects have.\nThere are two types of descriptors: data descriptors and non-data ones.\nIf a descriptor implements both1 __get__() and __set__(), it's\ncalled a data descriptor; otherwise is a non-data descriptor.\n\n\n\n\n     Tip \n    \n        Data descriptors take precedence over the instance's dictionary of\nattributes, whereas in the case of a non-data descriptor, the\ninstance's internal dictionary may be looked up first.\n    \n\nThe difference between them, lies on how the properties in the object\nare accessed, meaning which path will the MRO (Method Resolution\nOrder) of Python follow, in order to comply with our instruction.\nFor a non-data descriptor, when we have an statement like:\n\nPython will update the instance's internal dictionary under the key for\nthe name of the attribute, and store the value in it. This follows the\ndefault behaviour of setting an attribute in an instance because there\nis no __set__ defined to override it.\nOn the other hand, if we have a data descriptor (also called\noverriding descriptor), for the same instruction the __set__ method\nwill be ran because it's defined. And analogously, when we access the\nproperty like:\n\nThe __get__ on descriptor is what's going to be called.\nSo, again, data (overriding) descriptors take precedence over the\ninternal dictionary of an object, whereas non data (non-overriding) ones\ndo not.\nLookup on Non-data Descriptors\nOn the previous example,\nwhen the object was first created it didn't have any values for their\nproperties. If we inspect the object, and its class, we'll see that it\ndoesn't have any keys set for 'tv', but the class does:\n\nWhen we run media.tv the first time, there is no key 'tv' on\nmedia.__dict__, so Python tries to search in the class, and founds\none, it gets the object, sees that the object has a __get__, and\nreturns whatever that method returns.\nHowever when we set the value like media.tv = (4096, 2160), there is\nno __set__ defined for the descriptor, so Python runs with the default\nbehaviour in this case, which is updating media.__dict__. Therefore,\nnext time we ask for this attribute, it's going to be found in the\ninstance's dictionary and returned. By analogy we can see that it\ndoesn't have a __delete__ method either, so when the instruction\ndel media.tv runs, this attribute will be deleted from\nmedia.__dict__, which leaves us back in the original scenario, where\nthe descriptor takes place, acting as a default value holder.\nFunctions are non-data descriptors\nThis is how methods work in Python: function objects, are non-data\ndescriptors that implement __get__().\nIf we think about it, according to object-oriented software theory, an\nobject is a computational abstraction that represents an entity of the\ndomain problem. An object has a set of methods that can work with, which\ndetermines its interface (what the object is and can do)2.\nHowever, in more technical terms, objects are just implemented with a\ndata structure (that in Python are dictionaries), and it's behaviour,\ndetermined by their methods, are just functions. Again, methods are just\nfunctions. Let's prove it3.\nIf we have a class like this and inspect its dictionary we'll see that\nwhatever we defined as methods, are actually functions stored internally\nin the dictionary of the class.\n\nWe can see that among all the things defined in the class, it's\ndictionary contains an entry for 'greet', whose value is a function.\n\nThis means that in fact, it's the same as having a function defined\noutside the class, that knows how to work with an instance of that same\nclass, which by convention in Python is called self. Therefore inside\nthe class, we're just creating functions that know how to work with an\ninstance of that class, and Python will provide this object, as a first\nparameter, under the name that we usually call self. This is basically\nwhat the __get__ method does for functions: it returns a bound\ninstance of the function to that object.\nIn CPython, this logic is implemented in C, but let's see if we can\ncreate an equivalent example, just to get a clear picture. Imagine we\nhave a custom function, and we want to apply it to a class, as an\ninstance method.\nFirst we have an isolated function, that computes the mean time between\nfailures for an object that collects metrics on systems that monitors.\nThen we have a class called SystemMonitor, that represents all sort of\nobjects that collect metrics on monitored systems.\n\nFor now we just test the function, but soon we'll want this as a method\nof the class. We can easily apply the function to work with a\nSystemMonitor instance:\n\nBut now we want it to be part of the class, so that I can use it as a\ninstance method. If we try to assign the function as a method, it will\njust fail, because it's not bound:\n\nIn this case the system_monitor positional argument that requires, is\nthe instance, which in methods is referred to as self.\nNow, if the function is bound to the object, the scenario changes. We\ncan do that the same way Python does: __get__.\n\nNow, we want to be able to define this function inside the class, the\nsame way we do with methods, like def mtbf(self):.... In this case,\nfor simplicity, I'll just use a callable object, that represents the\nactual object function (the body of __call__ would represent what we\nput on the body of the function after it's definition). And we'll\ndeclare it as an attribute of the class, much like all methods:\n\nProvided that MTBF is a callable object (again, representing our\n\"function\"), is equivalent to doing def mtbf(self): ... inside the\nclass.\nIn the body of the callable, we can just reuse the original function,\nfor simplicity. What's really interesting is the __get__ method, on\nwhich we return the callable object, exposed as a method.\n\nTo explain: the attribute mtbf is a \"function\" (callable actually),\ndefined in the class. When we call it as a method, Python will see it\nhas a __get__, and when this is called, it will return another object\nwhich is the function bound to the instance, passing self as first\nparameter, which in turn is what's going to be executed.\nThis does the trick of making functions work as methods, which is a very\nelegant solution of CPython.\nWe can now appreciate the elegance of the design behind methods: instead\nof creating a whole new object, reuse functions under the assumption\nthat the first parameter will be an instance of that class, that is\ngoing to be used internally, and by convention called self (although,\nit can be called otherwise).\nFollowing a similar logic, classmethod, and staticmethod decorators,\nare also descriptors. The former, passes the class as the first argument\n(which is why class methods start with cls as a first argument), and\nthe latter, simply returns the function as it is.\nLookup on Data Descriptors\nOn the previous example, when we assigned a value to the property of the\ndescriptor, the instance dictionary was modified because there was no\n__set__ method on the descriptor.\nFor data descriptors, unlike on the previous example, the methods on the\ndescriptor object take precedence, meaning that the lookup starts by the\nclass, and doesn't affect the instance's dictionary. This is an\nasymmetry, that characterises data descriptors.\nOn the previous examples, if after running the descriptor, the\n__dict__ on the instance was modified, it was because the code\nexplicitly did so, but it could have had a different logic.\n\nIf we run it, we can see, that since this descriptor holds the data\ninternally, __dict__ is never modified on the instance4:\n\nMethod Lookup\nThe descriptors machinery is triggered by __getattribute__, so we have\nto be careful if we are overriding this method (better not), because if\nit's not done properly, we might prevent the descriptor calls5\n\n\n    \n\n\n\n     WARNING \n    \n        Classes might turn off the descriptor protocol by overriding\n`__getattribute__`.\n    \n\n1\nhttps://docs.python.org/3.6/howto/descriptor.html#descriptor-protocol\n\n2\nDuck typing\n\n3\nThis means that in reality, objects are just data structures with\nfunctions on it, much like ADT (Abstract Data Types) in C, or the\nstructs defined in Go with the functions that work over them. A more\ndetailed analysis and explanation of this, deserves a separate post.\n\n4\nThis is not a good practice, (except for very particular scenarios\nthat might require it, of course), but it's shown only to support\nthe idea.\n\n5\nhttps://docs.python.org/3/howto/descriptor.html#invoking-descriptors\n\n","id":"https://rmariano.eu/types-of-descriptors/","title":"Types of Descriptors"},"https://rmariano.eu/upcoming-talk-at-europython-2016/":{"body":"I am glad to inform that I will be speaking at EuroPython 2016\nconference.\nI'll speak @europython 2016:'Clean code in Python' https://t.co/e4clWU3aDM— Mariano (@rmarianoa) March 27, 2016 \nMy submission about clean code in Python was accepted, so in the next\nedition of EuroPython 2016, in Bilbao, Spain, I will talk about clean\ncode principles for Python.

However there might be a problem in\nthe community if both Python 3 and 2 coexist. The former one was great\nand brilliant, but it is time to start writing software in the new\nversion in order to move towards new features and improvements.\nLet's start by the beginning. One of the reasons I always preferred\nPython over the rest of the programming languages is because it is more\nadvanced, meaning that included many concepts that other languages did\nnot. For example, think of how early Python adopted ideas like lambda\nfunctions, dynamic typing, duck typing, context managers, metaclasses\nand so on, while other technologies (namely Java, C++ for example1)\nwere still using data structures and calling them \"objects\". Python\nhas always been many steps ahead.\nGreat news are that this is no over: Python is still improving at a fast\npace. And that is precisely the issue with Python 3. As a result of that\nevolution, the new version of Python must change some of its internals\nin order to properly implement new features, and this is what lead it to\nbe incompatible with earlier versions, which should not be a problem.\nBut it seems it is.\nSome developers do not like the new release, and they are not keen on\nmigrating the code base. They argue that Python 3 \"is wrong\" because\nit is not backwards compatible, but my question here is why are we\nthinking backwards instead of forwards. A programming language as a\nmodel or concept, must evolve, improve, so we should be thinking on the\nfuture of the language rather that on its past. I think they are missing\nthe new ideas, the way Python is changing in order to incorporate more\nefficient mechanisms. Perhaps this time, the leap was too big.\nI think the best for the language is to adopt its new version, and do\nnot think of it as a different one.
