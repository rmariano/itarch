  <h1><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;rmariano.eu&#x2F;pycon-cz-day-1&#x2F;">PyCon CZ - Day 1</a></h1>
  
  <div class="post-content"><p>The day started at 9.00, and at first it was time of check-in, etc.
After that, I solved one riddle by <code>kiwi.com</code>, and earned a discount in
flights, which was a nice way to start the conference.</p>
<p>Then after breakfast and some networking going through the booths of the
sponsors, it was time for the first talk of the day: &quot;<em>When bugs bite -
why neglecting edge cases can kill</em>&quot;.</p>
<p>It was a great talk, a case for software engineering in general (it's
not Python-specific, which is what makes the topic more interesting).
The best thing I liked about the talk was the remarks, and the idea of
shifting the mindset when it comes to development, so we should do some
&quot;negative thinking&quot; in the form of <em>what can go wrong with this?</em> <em>How
can this fail?</em>, and such. It's important, because this is critical in
order to make robust software. Most problems I have seen on software
bugs were related to some optimistic thinking, and even worse,
optimistic unit testing, in the way that developers only test for
happy-path scenarios, without thinking all sort of things that can go
wrong.</p>
<p>Afterwards, was the time for the talk about parallel processing (<em>poor
person's parallel processing</em>), which was fine. Then I spent some time
tackling some of the challenges sponsors had available, so I did some
coding and recap of the events so far.</p>
<p>Then I listened to a talk about
<a href="https://cz.pycon.org/2017/speakers/detail/talk/28/#main">wolfcrypt</a>
which is a tool for <code>crypto</code> in Python. The talk introduced some
<code>crypto</code> concepts (symmetric <code>crypto</code>, public key, etc.), which was
good. Most of the questions revolved around comparison with other tools
in python (default libraries, <code>pycrypto</code>, etc.).</p>
<p>Then it was time for lunch and do some more coding, and the next talk I
attended to was called &quot;<em>should I mock or should I not?</em>&quot;, which I
liked very much and gave some food for thought.</p>
<p>Then it came one more talk, after which it was time for mine, so I
presented <em>clean code in Python</em>. There were some interesting questions,
and the entire presentation went relatively quickly.</p>
<p>Once the talk sessions were over, there was one last track for lightning
talks, which are always super entertaining.</p>
<p>After the finish of the first day, I attended the speaker's dinner,
which was a nice opportunity to network with the community, which is
always great.</p>
<p>Looking forward to some more interesting talks tomorrow, and to see the
results of the challenges.</p>
