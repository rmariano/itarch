It\'s been a while since I started tracking versions of my custom Vim
configuration, and making it available as an open source software in
[Github](https://github.com/rmariano/vim-config). The best of this
project is, in my opinion, to have it under version control, so I can
track changes and releases.

Every once in a while, when I find a new setting, or a great new
feature, I modify the configuration, so they will become available on
the next release. Besides the features that are mentioned in the
project, and the customizations made, I feel very comfortable with the
colour scheme I made.

Here are some glimpses of it:

The colour scheme is general for the syntax highlighting of all types
recognized by Vim. Please note this might also depend on the
configuration of your terminal.

menus.</figcaption>

Any suggestions or improvements to the code and configuration can be
made on the [Github](https://github.com/rmariano/vim-config) project.
