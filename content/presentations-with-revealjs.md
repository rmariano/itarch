Old-fashioned PPT\'s presentations are from the 90\'s, and let\'s face
it, we are in the age of the web browser. So, the last time I had to
gave a talk, I decided to use a better technical support.

After a quick search for alternatives, I found many options, including
well-known libraries, until I finally decided for
[reveal.js](https://lab.hakim.se/reveal-js/#/).

It is written in JavaScript with good CSS themes, and it does not
require expert knowledge on those technologies. In order to play the
presentation, you launch an HTML file from a web browser or you can also
run it with a static server.

Advantages:

-   Version control: Given the fact that your presentation is made from
    source code, it is possible to track changes by using git.
-   A better cross-platform support: it does not rely on a particular
    software in a particular version to be present (web browsers are
    ubiquitous nowadays).
-   Compatibility: [WYSIWYG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WYSIWYG).
-   Able to host your presentation in the cloud and access it from
    anywhere.

Reasons to use it / nice things about it:

-   We are in 2014
-   Supports Markdown language

To be clear: I am not saying that this is a better alternative because
is newer of modern, but because of the advantages listed. In other
words, if we count with developed tools at our disposal, it would be a
good idea to use them.

Here are some simple and basic examples of
[presentations](https://rmariano.github.io/presentations/) I am working
on. (DISCLAIMER: they might be in different languages, and the page is
in progress).
