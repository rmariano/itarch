Alpine is a software I definitely recommend for those who like
minimalistic applications that go straight to the point in order to get
the things done. It\'s an email client, with no GUI, which allows me to
read emails better than by means of the web page[^1] without any
distractions, focusing on what is just important. It is also great that
shows only the text (the relevant part of the email) and it can follow
the links by launching the default browser.

It is simple, fast and perfectly suitable for checking my old inbox with
weekly lists updates. It\'s inherited from an old project, called pine,
and in Fedora it can be installed by:

``` bash
sudo dnf install alpine
```

Then you just need to configure the email account settings (one last
time to visit the page, but that would be the last :-) and you\'re
ready.
