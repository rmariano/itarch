The proposal of my talk titled \"*Discovering Descriptors*\", was
accepted for the next edition of [PyCon CZ](https://cz.pycon.org/2017/),
in Prague, Czech Republic. Although the schedule is not yet ready, this
talk will most likely be on June 8th.

The first two days of the conference (June 8th and June 9th), will be
for talks, whilst the last one (Saturday, June 10), will be for
workshops (sprints).

This is another interesting opportunity to share and learn from the
Python community, as it was last year when [I presented at EuroPython
2016](link://slug/my-talk-europython-2016). On this occasion, I plan to
post an entry with the events, per each day of the conference.
