It\'s been a while since I started tracking versions of my custom Vim
configuration, and making it available as an open source software in
[Github](https://github.com/rmariano/vim-config). The best of this
project is, in my opinion, to have it under version control, so I can
track changes and releases.

Every once in a while, when I find a new setting, or a great new
feature, I modify the configuration, so they will become available on
the next release. Besides the features that are mentioned in the
project, and the customizations made, I feel very comfortable with the
colour scheme I made.

Here are some glimpses of it:

alt="Vim capture 1" />

The colour scheme is general for the syntax highlighting of all types
recognized by Vim. Please note this might also depend on the
configuration of your terminal.

Any suggestions or improvements to the code and configuration can be
made on the [Github](https://github.com/rmariano/vim-config) project.
