A review of the events that took place this year, related to software
engineering and architecture.

# The conferences, talks, and events

These are some of the events I participated in:

-   (2 Apr 2016) `PROTOSEC` 2016[^1]: A technical conference about
    networking, protocols, security, and related topics.
-   (July 2016) EuroPython 2016: I attended several talks, trainings,
    workshops, and [presented a
    talk](link://slug/my-talk-europython-2016).
-   (10 Sep 2016) `Python Córdoba meetup`[^2]: interesting meetup where
    I presented my talk at EuroPython and attended the sprints
    afterwards.
-   (14 Sep 2016) `ArqConf` Meetup *¿Cómo es trabajar distribuido
    globalmente? Caso Open Stack*[^3]: Hosted in the Red Hat\'s offices
    in Buenos Aires, this talk was a very interesting one, on which I
    learned about the collaborative way of working of the Open Stack
    team, around the globe.
-   (17 Nov 2016) [Python Barcelona
    meetup](link://slug/python-barcelona-november-meetup-notes).
-   (9 Dec 2016) Barcelona Spark meetup[^4]
-   (22 Dec 2016) Python Barcelona December meetup[^5]: I presented my
    talk about clean code in Python (yes, again :-), and there were two
    other interesting talks. Mine was the first one of the evening. The
    second talk, was about `zc.buildout`, an interesting tool for
    managing packages and environments in Python, which I first heard of
    at `PyconAr` (Python Argentina group) 2012. The third and last talk,
    presented a project named `aiocache`[^6]: a cache system implemented
    in `asyncio`, that supports multiple back-ends. The talk walked us
    through the code, its architecture, and some use cases with demos.

# Code wise

I started with a small contribution to the `coala` project[^7], and
during the EuroPython sprints I contributed to `aiohttp` with a pull
request.

There were two new [releases of my vim
configuration](https://github.com/rmariano/vim-config/releases),
versions `v0.3` and `v0.4`[^8], which is great because is the single
tool I use every day, and it is nice to have several improvements on it.

I also enhanced my [dot files](https://github.com/rmariano/dotfiles),
but that is still in beta.

# On general

A minor release of `Python3.5`, but most importantly: `Python3.6` was
recently released!

There were two releases of `Fedora`, 24 and 25, and there were lots of
improvements and changes in the `Linux Kernel`.

Regarding information security, there were some issues in the Linux
Kernel, also in applications (such as dirty COW, etc.), and a massive
DDoS attack that stroke the Internet on October, due to `IoT` devices
being compromised.

# What to look forward to for the new year

-   I still look forward for more contributions to open source, in
    particular with CPython.
-   More functional programming (Scala/Haskell maybe), low-level
    programming in C, and research in the field of `infosec`.
-   Keep on participating on technical conferences.

And a lot more.
