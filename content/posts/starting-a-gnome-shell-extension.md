Since I moved from Ubuntu to Fedora early this year, I changed my
desktop environment from unity to Gnome Shell.

I must say it is a great experience. At the beginning I was thinking on
what was better compared to unity (because I did not like Unity).
Regarding this comparison I found a more stable and usable window
manager. I still prefer something simpler perhaps, but it works good and
it is nice.

Just out of curiosity, one day I started managing some extensions. Oh,
by the way, you will probably be installing some extensions for Gnome
shell, some of them are useful and some others make it more usable. That
drove me to the extensions developer API, which turned out to be quite
simple and interesting.

Having played a little bit, I decided to code a (very) simple extension
that does just one single thing. I called it \"simple-name\" and it is
available at:
[Simple-Name-Extension](https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/807/simple-name/)

It remembers some little detail I was missing from some previous window
managers that I have used along the years, which is to display the
username of the currently logged-in user.

I must say that, I code it just for the sake of learning and
experimenting with and API and a bit of JavaScript. In addition I found
very interesting to see front-end related technologies like JavaScript
or CSS used in the desktop environment (not that is something new, but
still funny).

To sum up, I wanted to highlight that is interesting to learn new
technologies, even with little and simple steps like a new API, library,
etc. It is not for the technology itself, but for the sake of learning
:)
