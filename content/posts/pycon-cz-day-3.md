The third day of the conference was hosted on a different venue, [the
Czech Technical University of Prague](http://bit.ly/2sihbUj).

# The workshops

I signed up for two workshops: [search for fun (and
profit)](https://cz.pycon.org/2017/speakers/detail/workshop/3/#main),
and [Effectively running python applications in Kubernetes /
OpenShift](https://cz.pycon.org/2017/speakers/detail/workshop/5/#main).

They were both great, and left me with lots of interesting topics for
research and do further work.

The first one walked through the workings of
[elasticsearch-dsl-py](https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch-dsl-py),
which was great not only because the explanations were superb, but also
because there is probably no better way to review this than from the
author himself. I was already experienced with the library, since I\'ve
used, `Elasticsearch` with Python, but even though, this workshop gave
me a deeper understanding of the concepts behind it (there was a lot
about the internals of `Elasticsearch`, how it works, its configuration,
concepts of information retrieval, etc.), so I got new ideas. On the
practical side, I\'ll check [this
project](https://github.com/HonzaKral/es-django-example).

The second one started with an overview of `Kubernetes` and `OpenShift`,
and shortly thereafter, we started with the practical assignment, on
which we deployed [an application](https://github.com/soltysh/blast) on
the `OpenShift` cloud.

The tools required for this are quite interesting. Personally, I prefer
the command line tool (`oc` client) to the web interface, not only
because it seems more familiar (for one using Linux), but also because
it provides more features and a richer interface. For example (at this
point), cron jobs cannot be created through the web interface, but only
from the command line with this client (and it was part of the
exercise). I personally always find the command line much more complete,
useful, and rich (for example it allows automation, scripting, etc.),
compared to `UIs`, so I\'ll use the client.
