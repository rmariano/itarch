The next Saturday 10 of September, I will be presenting my talk \"Clean
Code in Python\", as presented in the previous EuroPython 2016, at a
local Python event in CÃ³rdoba, Argentina[^1][^2].

The following week, I will be attending a local architecture meetup
(arqconf), on which a talk[^3] about OpenStack will be hosted,
explaining how they work in a distributed fashion.

I look forward to enjoying both events!
