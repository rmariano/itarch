It was a great year, let\'s take a look at the main highlights.

Early in January, I presented a
[talk](link://slug/exploring-generators-and-coroutines) at a local
meetup, which had a good reception amongst the audience. The fist part
of the year was a great period for learning more about distributed
systems, event sourcing, and event-driven architectures. The peak of
which was attending the [Kafka summit in
London](link://slug/notes-on-the-kafka-summit-london-2018).

By late August/early September I finished my book [Clean code in
Python](https://www.amazon.com/Clean-Code-Python-Refactor-legacy/dp/1788835832)
which was a quite challenging experience.

It was a great pleasure to attend the [Python San
Sebasti√°n](link://slug/notes-on-pyss18) conference. I\'ve heard about
this conference in a lightning talk in EuroPython, and I was curious
about it. It was good to meet a group of friendly new people, and having
the opportunity to present there (an enhanced version of the talk
presented at the meetup in January). Besides, the city is amazing, so
it\'s certainly something to repeat!

Besides some improvements in my configuration files (vim and dot files),
and to some of my other public repositories, there wasn\'t that much
room for open source contributions. On the other hand, there was a good
deal of learning: I\'ve read some fantastic books about software
engineering (such as *Facts and fallacies of software engineering*,
*Object-oriented software construction*, and more), which unfortunately
I wasn\'t able to cover in blog posts (but maybe in the future I will),
and I successfully completed the [machine learning course offered by
Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning), which was
*amazing*. Again, maybe in a future post I will be able to properly
review it, but for now I can just tell you that is highly recommendable,
if you\'re looking forward to learn a ton and at the same time have fun
solving programming assignments.

All in all, it was a year with a lot of positive notes. Looking forward
to an amazing 2019 for everyone!
