Another year went by, and although I haven\'t blogged that much this
year, quite a few things did happen. Let\'s take a quick review of them.

As you know, I attended [FOSDEM 2019](link://slug/notes-on-fosdem19),
back in February, and it was an exhilarating event.

I also took the opportunity to dive more into functional programming
with Scala, by completing the online course in Coursera (which I highly
recommend).

On the open source front, I started with some humble contributions to
the [grpc](https://github.com/grpc/grpc) project, with the goal to add
asynchronous support for the Python implementation.

I also read many interesting books. Among those about software
engineering, I would also like to recommend [Software Creativity 2.0 by
Robert
Glass](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/123717.Software_Creativity_2_0).

What to look forward to for the 2020? I would like to repeat the
`FOSDEM` experience, and keep on contributing to open source projects,
as much as possible. There\'s also the possibility (however I can\'t
promise anything), that I might start a YouTube channel, with content
similar to the one on this blog. But as always there will be more that I
can\'t anticipate; the best is usually the unexpected!

Happy 2020 to everybody!
