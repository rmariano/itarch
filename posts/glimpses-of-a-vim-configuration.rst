It's been a while since I started tracking versions of my custom Vim configuration, and making it available as an open source software in Github_.
The best of this project is, in my opinion, to have it under version control, so I can track changes and releases.

Every once in a while, when I find a new setting, or a great new feature, I modify the configuration, so they will become available on the next release.
Besides the features that are mentioned in the project, and the customizations made, I feel very comfortable with the colour scheme I made.

Here are some glimpses of it:


.. figure:: ../vim-capture1.png
   :align: center

   First capture of colours, and layout


The colour scheme is general for the syntax highlighting of all types recognized by Vim. Please note this might also depend on the configuration of your terminal.


.. figure:: ../vim-capture2.png
   :align: center

   The tabs are also themed according to the menus.


Any suggestions or improvements to the code and configuration can be made on the Github_ project.
