Python 3 is the future of Python, but is not compatible with Python 2, meaning that code
written in the former one will have to be updated. This seems to cause a problem
among many developers that are not very keen to it.

They argue that Python 3 "is wrong" because it is not *backwards* compatible, but my
question here is why are we thinking *backwards* instead of *forward*. A programming
language as a model or concept, must evolve, improve, meaning that we should be thinking
on the future of the language rather that on its past. This has been me most outstanding trait
of Python along the years: the reason why it was a more evolved technology compared to
Java or C# for instance.

I think the best for the language is to adopt its new version, meaning that old, legacy
Python 2 code should be either replaced or disregarded.
