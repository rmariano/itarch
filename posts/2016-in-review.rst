A review of the events that took place this year, related to software
engineering and architecture.


The conferences, talks, and events
----------------------------------

These are some of the events I participated in:

* (2 Apr 2016) ``PROTOSEC`` 2016 [1]_: A technical conference about networking,
  protocols, security, and related topics.

* (July 2016) EuroPython 2016: I attended several talks, trainings, workshops,
  and `presented a talk <link://slug/my-talk-europython-2016>`_.

* (10 Sep 2016) ``Python Córdoba meetup`` [6]_: interesting meetup where I
  presented my talk at EuroPython and attended the sprints afterwards.

* (14 Sep 2016) ``ArqConf`` Meetup *¿Cómo es trabajar distribuido globalmente?
  Caso Open Stack* [5]_: Hosted in the Red Hat's offices in Buenos Aires, this
  talk was a very interesting one, on which I learned about the collaborative
  way of working of the Open Stack team, around the globe.

* (17 Nov 2016) `Python Barcelona meetup
  <link://slug/python-barcelona-november-meetup-notes>`_.

* (9 Dec 2016) Barcelona Spark meetup [2]_

* (22 Dec 2016) Python Barcelona December meetup [7]_: I presented my talk
  about clean code in Python (yes, again :-), and there were two other
  interesting talks. Mine was the first one of the evening.  The second talk,
  was about ``zc.buildout``, an interesting tool for managing packages and
  environments in Python, which I first heard of at
  ``PyconAr`` (Python Argentina group) 2012.  The third and last talk,
  presented a project named ``aiocache`` [8]_: a cache system implemented in
  ``asyncio``, that supports multiple back-ends. The talk walked us through the
  code, its architecture, and some use cases with demos.


Code wise
---------

I started with a small contribution to the ``coala`` project [3]_, and during
the EuroPython sprints I contributed to ``aiohttp`` with a pull request.

There were two new `releases of my vim configuration
<https://github.com/rmariano/vim-config/releases>`_, versions ``v0.3`` and
``v0.4`` [4]_, which is great because is the single tool I use every day, and
it is nice to have several improvements on it.

I also enhanced my `dot files <https://github.com/rmariano/dotfiles>`_, but
that is still in beta.


On general
----------

A minor release of ``Python3.5``, but most importantly: ``Python3.6`` was
recently released!

There were two releases of ``Fedora``, 24 and 25, and there were lots of
improvements and changes in the ``Linux Kernel``.

Regarding information security, there were some issues in the Linux Kernel,
also in applications (such as dirty COW, etc.), and a massive DDoS attack that
stroke the Internet on October, due to ``IoT`` devices being compromised.


What to look forward to for the new year
----------------------------------------

* I still look forward for more contributions to open source, in particular
  with CPython.

* More functional programming (Scala/Haskell maybe), low-level programming in
  C, and research in the field of ``infosec``.

* Keep on participating on technical conferences.

And a lot more.
