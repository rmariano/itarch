Classical PPT's presentations are from the 90's, and let's face it, we are in the
age of the web browser.

After a quick search for alternatives, I found many options, including
well-known libraries, until I finally decided for reveal.js_.

It is written in JavaScript with good CSS themes, and it does not require expert knowledge,
just with understanding the logical structure of HTML is enough.
In order to run it, you launch the presentation file from a web browser or you can run it
with a server.


Advantages:

- Version control: Given the fact that your presentation is made from source code, it is possible
  to track changes by using git.

- A better cross-platform support: it does not rely on a particular software
  in a particular version to be present (web browsers are ubiquitous nowadays).

- Compatibility.

- Able to host your presentation in the cloud and access it from anywhere.


Reasons to use it / nice things about it:

- We are in 2014

- Supports Markdown language

Here are some simple and basic examples of presentations_ I am working on.
(DISCLAIMER: they might be in different languages among themselves).
