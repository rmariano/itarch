  <h1><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;rmariano.eu&#x2F;a-view-on-fosdem-2020&#x2F;">A View on FOSDEM 2020</a></h1>
  
  <div class="post-content"><p>Another year, another <code>FOSDEM</code> edition. As always, since this conference
grew so big (fact: if you tried to watch all videos in a row, it'll
take you about 9 weeks!), chances are, every review you read from the
conference will contain something different, and therefore,
complementary.</p>
<p>This is what I was able to experience. Let's take a look.</p>
<p>A recurrent theme in <code>FOSDEM</code> seems to be the high concurrency. There
were lots of people attending, which made it difficult to make it into
some dev-rooms, as they were overcrowded. In addition, some very popular
dev-rooms got regular-size rooms where not enough people could fit (for
example the <code>PostgreSQL</code> one, as opposed to last year). Because of this,
I missed quite a few opportunities.</p>
<p>However, another trait of the conference is not only the high
concurrency, but also the high quality of the talks. Therefore, falling
back to some any other talk ended up on me learning about some cool
topic, with the added element of surprise.</p>
<h1 id="the-talks">The Talks</h1>
<p>On Saturday, I started the morning in the free Java dev-room, and the
first talk I watched was
<code>Tornado VM: A Java VM for heterogeneous hardware</code>. It introduced the
idea of having a VM that takes advantage of different hardware (not just
CPU, but also GPUs, and <code>FPGAs</code> as well). Though it was Java-focused, it
did mention that the concepts are applicable to other languages as well.</p>
<p>The followed a talk about
<a href="https://fosdem.org/2020/schedule/event/bytebuffers/">ByteBuffers</a>. A
really nice presentation of the new memory management API (coming up to
Java 14). It presented the rationale, common performance issues, the
goals of accessing memory on and off the heap, and such.</p>
<p>Afterwards, I went to the <a href="https://fosdem.org/2020/schedule/event/early_unix/">The Hidden Early History of
Unix</a>.</p>
<p>One of the highlights of the conference was <a href="https://fosdem.org/2020/schedule/event/kubernetes/">Fixing the Kubernetes
clusterfuck</a>. An
amazing talk (I highly recommend you watch the video), with a live
demonstration of how to hack (and detect) a <code>Kubernetes</code> cluster. It
started with a very good introduction to the
<a href="https://github.com/falcosecurity/falco">falco</a> project (how it's
built, how it works, how it integrates with another tools, and its
capabilities). It's a project with interesting features (like for
instance the fact that uses <code>eBPF</code> makes it have a minimal overhead).</p>
<p>The next three talks continued with the security theme. The first one of
them also about containers: <a href="https://fosdem.org/2020/schedule/event/security_using_selinux_with_container_runtimes/">Using SELinux with container
runtimes</a>,
<a href="https://fosdem.org/2020/schedule/event/security_the_hairy_issue_of_e2e_encryption_in_instant_messaging/">The hairy issue of e2e encryption in instant
messaging</a>,
and <a href="https://fosdem.org/2020/schedule/event/security_what_you_most_likely_did_not_know_about_sudo/">What you most likely did not know about
sudo</a>.</p>
<p>And that closed up the first day.</p>
<p>On Sunday, I started by attending two talks about monitoring and
observability. On [Distributed tracing for beginners]{.title-ref} we saw
a live demo of applying tracing to a Java application, from the ground
up, and seeing the metrics with <a href="https://www.jaegertracing.io/">Jaeger</a>.
Then came a talk about <a href="https://fosdem.org/2020/schedule/event/tracing_grafana/">Grafana: successfully correlate metics, logs,
and traces</a>
which was a very good continuation. It was also interesting to learn
about upcoming features to <code>Grafana</code> (such as linking to traces from the
metrics graphs directly, and more integrations).</p>
<p>Afterwards, I attended another talk about <a href="https://fosdem.org/2020/schedule/event/swim/">SWIM - Protocol to build a
cluster</a>, and on the same
room came the talk about <a href="https://fosdem.org/2020/schedule/event/speculative_execution/">Implementing protections against Speculative
Execution side
channel</a>:
a really technical and well-presented talk explaining low-level security
implications of side channel attacks, and some recommendations on how to
avoid some of those issues. The talk introduced the <code>MDS / TAA</code> threat
models, and their implications. There were also really good questions
asked at the end, that provided very interesting food for thought.</p>
<p>On the evening, I was able to finally make it into the <code>PostgreSQL</code>
dev-room, and it was really worth it. The first talk was about <a href="https://fosdem.org/2020/schedule/event/postgresql_the_state_of_full_text_search_in_postgresql_12/">The
state of full-text search on PostgreSQL
12</a>.
It properly explained some of the internals that go on, when we try to
use this feature, and some caveats to avoid. It had a really nice
introduction to information retrieval, and how it's implemented in
<code>PostgreSQL</code>.</p>
<p>Finally, <a href="https://fosdem.org/2020/schedule/event/postgresql_rtfm/">RTFM</a>
(don't be misled --as I was--, by the title), presented four case
studies on which things went south, and why. The learnings on all cases,
provided valuable insights on how to make a better use of our relational
database.</p>
<p>Then came the closing talk, celebrating the 20 years of the conference.</p>
<p>All in all, another good edition of the European conference for open
source. There's still lots of material that I would like to go over in
more detail, and some missed talks that I have to catch up on, but it
was a good experience.</p>
