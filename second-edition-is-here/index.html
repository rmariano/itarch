  <div class="post-content"><p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Clean-Code-Python-maintainable-efficient/dp/1800560214">Clean code in Python, second
edition</a>
has been published, and here are the main highlights!</p>
<p><img src="https://media.githubusercontent.com/media/rmariano/Clean-code-in-Python/main/book/cover.png" alt="Cover" /></p>
<h1 id="what-s-new-from-the-previous-edition">What's new from the previous edition?</h1>
<p>The main change is that the book has been updated to <code>Python 3.9</code>. The previous
edition was started when <code>Python 3.6</code> was new, and by the time it got published,
<code>Python 3.7</code> was just recently released. Since then, a lot has
changed in Python and the book addresses the new features.</p>
<p>In particular, there's been a lot of improvements in the area of
asynchronous programming. More to the point, asynchronous programming is
becoming even more common on all projects, so the entire chapter 7
(originally dedicated to generators and iteration) has been revisited
with a strong focus on asynchronous programming, showing how to also
write more succinct code in this model.</p>
<p>All chapters have been revisited, and the examples updated to take
advantage of the latest developments in Python. One example is the new
assignment expression, introduced in <code>Python 3.8</code>. This new
edition shows how to take advantage of those features in order to write
more compact code that's easier to read and maintain.</p>
<p>The tools and libraries have been upgraded as well, and more tools are
introduced. For instance, important concepts like dependency injection
are now supported with a library that makes things easier in Python.</p>
<h1 id="what-to-expect-from-the-book">What to expect from the book</h1>
<p>You can expect a new version that follows the same pattern of presenting
an introduction to the concepts being learnt, followed by examples that
illustrate the idea. As always, I try to keep the examples concise as to
avoid distractions, and focus on the topic at hand, whilst at the same
time, make them relevant examples. This means, the code in the book
represents situations that might very well happen in a real project, as
opposed to made-up things like Fibonacci sequences.</p>
<p>The challenge here is try to make it relevant for different audiences:
software developers, systems administrators, and data scientists. Even
though the book focuses on software construction, the concepts (and
their corresponding examples), are also relevant for data processing for
example.</p>
<p>It's still a book with a <em>pragmatic approach</em>. I discuss the theory,
but at the end of the day, the goal is that you're presented with
something you can effectively implement in your day-to-day tasks. In
this regard, the examples are clear enough that you could extrapolate
from them to apply the concept for yourself in your projects.</p>
<h1 id="what-motivated-me-to-write-a-new-edition">What motivated me to write a new edition</h1>
<p>You! Yes, the first edition got a really good reception. Thank you for
your feedback and support! I'm always looking for ways to share my
knowledge and teach others so they can develop their skills. I started
this with my coworkers, then moved to meet-ups, and then I started
speaking at conferences. I've always believed that this way I could
share what I've learnt, so writing a book felt like the logical next
step. But I never really got a grasp on how many people were learning
from the content I produced, until I got your feedback from my first
book, and that really motivated me!</p>
<p>In addition to that, technology changes all the time, evolves, and we
(people) also improve over time. Over the past two years, since the
first edition a lot has changed in Python, and I've also growth a lot
(personally and professionally). I embarked into more challenging
projects, and gained more experience on good software engineering
practices and running projects at scale. At the same rate, Python was
releasing new versions with more features. The confluence of these two
things, landed me into the realization that was time for a new, improved
version of the book.</p>
<p>I hope you enjoy this edition as much as I did writing it! :-)</p>
