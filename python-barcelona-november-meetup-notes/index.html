  <div class="post-content"><p>Last Thursday November 17, 2016, there was a Python meetup in
Barcelona<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#1">1</a></sup>, with a set of interesting talks.</p>
<p>The first one was hosted by two representatives of the government of
Catalunya, and Barcelona city, and they presented the technical
challenges they are facing, and the new stack proposed for oncoming
projects. In this regard, it was interesting to see how they have lots
of legacy applications written in J2EE, with Java frameworks, that are
outdated, difficult to maintain, and they mentioned the idea of
migrating them to new, more modern technologies. In this sense, there
are already projects in progress, and they chose Python + Django for the
migration and re-implementation of the legacy systems.</p>
<p>This was a very interesting in the sense that more than this was
actually presented. In particular the idea of how the government wants
to actually own their systems, and therefore they are now choosing open
source software. It goes beyond than merely using Python and Django:
they are also migrating the workstation machines to open source software
(Ubuntu), and trying to earn more contractors that are startups rather
than huge multinationals with proprietary software. The idea is still
the same: they want open data, transparency, and to actually own their
systems.</p>
<p>These sort of initiatives are gaining more and more traction in the
European Union, as many cities are starting to shift towards an open
government, with open data, and more transparency. I look forward to
seeing more projects in Python with open source technologies, at their
GitHub account<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#2">2</a></sup>, in the forthcoming months.</p>
<p>The second talk was about
<a href="https://conda.pydata.org/docs/intro.html">Conda</a>, and shortly
thereafter a brief introduction, the rest of the presentation was mostly
a demo (live coding! :-), on which we saw several examples of installing
packages, exporting the environment, creating a new one from a template,
etc. It was useful to see both the strengths and shortcomings of the
tool, what can and cannot be done with it, and how it can be useful for
developers that have to deal with several system dependencies.</p>
<p>The third and last talk, was about <a href="https://plone.org/">PLONE</a>, a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content_management_system">CMS</a> project
written in Python, and with its 15-year-old tenure, is the oldest Python
project (thing that I did not know). It was interesting to learn about
its high-level architecture, components, and the way they work. Above
that, I would like to highlight the recap that it was done about many
underappreciated <a href="https://www.zope.org/">zope</a> libraries, that have been
available in Python for a long time, doing an amazing job. It is now in
my list, to review them.</p>
<p>All in all, it was a good meetup, and I liked very much the technical
level of the talks, and the fact that the topics were very diverse, yet
interesting. I would like to continue attending these meetups, and in
the future I might even submit a talk.</p>
